I O
At O
length O
I O
returned O
from O
two O
weeks O
leave O
of O
absence O
to O
find O
that O
my O
patrons O
had O
arrived O
three O
days O
ago O
in O
Roulettenberg. O
I O
received O
from O
them O
a O
welcome O
quite O
different O
to O
that O
which O
I O
had O
expected. O
The O
General O
eyed O
me O
coldly, O
greeted O
me O
in O
rather O
haughty O
fashion, O
and O
dismissed O
me O
to O
pay O
my O
respects O
to O
his O
sister. O
It O
was O
clear O
that O
from O
SOMEWHERE O
money O
had O
been O
acquired. O
I O
thought O
I O
could O
even O
detect O
a O
certain O
shamefacedness O
in O
the O
General's O
glance. O
Maria O
Philipovna, O
too, O
seemed O
distraught, O
and O
conversed O
with O
me O
with O
an O
air O
of O
detachment. O
Nevertheless, O
she O
took O
the O
money O
which O
I O
handed O
to O
her, O
counted O
it, O
and O
listened O
to O
what O
I O
had O
to O
tell. O
To O
luncheon O
there O
were O
expected O
that O
day O
a O
Monsieur O
Mezentsov, O
a O
French O
lady, O
and O
an O
Englishman; O
for, O
whenever O
money O
was O
in O
hand, O
a O
banquet O
in O
Muscovite O
style O
was O
always O
given. O
Polina O
Alexandrovna, O
on O
seeing O
me, O
inquired O
why O
I O
had O
been O
so O
long O
away. O
Then, O
without O
waiting O
for O
an O
answer, O
she O
departed. O
Evidently O
this O
was O
not O
mere O
accident, O
and O
I O
felt O
that O
I O
must O
throw O
some O
light O
upon O
matters. O
It O
was O
high O
time O
that O
I O
did O
so. O
I O
was O
assigned O
a O
small O
room O
on O
the O
fourth O
floor O
of O
the O
hotel O
(for O
you O
must O
know O
that O
I O
belonged O
to O
the O
General's O
suite). O
So O
far O
as O
I O
could O
see, O
the O
party O
had O
already O
gained O
some O
notoriety O
in O
the O
place, O
which O
had O
come O
to O
look O
upon O
the O
General O
as O
a O
Russian O
nobleman O
of O
great O
wealth. O
Indeed, O
even O
before O
luncheon O
he O
charged O
me, O
among O
other O
things, O
to O
get O
two O
thousand-franc O
notes O
changed O
for O
him O
at O
the O
hotel O
counter, O
which O
put O
us O
in O
a O
position O
to O
be O
thought O
millionaires O
at O
all O
events O
for O
a O
week! O
Later, O
I O
was O
about O
to O
take O
Mischa PERSON
and O
Nadia PERSON
for O
a O
walk O
when O
a O
summons O
reached O
me O
from O
the O
staircase O
that O
I O
must O
attend O
the O
General. O
He O
began O
by O
deigning O
to O
inquire O
of O
me O
where O
I O
was O
going O
to O
take O
the O
children; O
and O
as O
he O
did O
so, O
I O
could O
see O
that O
he O
failed O
to O
look O
me O
in O
the O
eyes. O
He O
WANTED O
to O
do O
so, O
but O
each O
time O
was O
met O
by O
me O
with O
such O
a O
fixed, O
disrespectful O
stare O
that O
he O
desisted O
in O
confusion. O
In O
pompous O
language, O
however, O
which O
jumbled O
one O
sentence O
into O
another, O
and O
at O
length O
grew O
disconnected, O
he O
gave O
me O
to O
understand O
that O
I O
was O
to O
lead O
the O
children O
altogether O
away O
from O
the O
Casino, O
and O
out O
into O
the O
park. O
Finally O
his O
anger O
exploded, O
and O
he O
added O
sharply: O
"I O
suppose O
you O
would O
like O
to O
take O
them O
to O
the O
Casino O
to O
play O
roulette? O
Well, O
excuse O
my O
speaking O
so O
plainly, O
but O
I O
know O
how O
addicted O
you O
are O
to O
gambling. O
Though O
I O
am O
not O
your O
mentor, O
nor O
wish O
to O
be, O
at O
least O
I O
have O
a O
right O
to O
require O
that O
you O
shall O
not O
actually O
compromise O
me." O
"I O
have O
no O
money O
for O
gambling," O
I O
quietly O
replied. O
"But O
you O
will O
soon O
be O
in O
receipt O
of O
some," O
retorted O
the O
General, O
reddening O
a O
little O
as O
he O
dived O
into O
his O
writing O
desk O
and O
applied O
himself O
to O
a O
memorandum O
book. O
From O
it O
he O
saw O
that O
he O
had O
120 O
roubles O
of O
mine O
in O
his O
keeping. O
"Let O
us O
calculate," O
he O
went O
on. O
"We O
must O
translate O
these O
roubles O
into O
thalers. O
Here--take O
100 O
thalers, O
as O
a O
round O
sum. O
The O
rest O
will O
be O
safe O
in O
my O
hands." O
In O
silence O
I O
took O
the O
money. O
"You O
must O
not O
be O
offended O
at O
what O
I O
say," O
he O
continued. O
"You O
are O
too O
touchy O
about O
these O
things. O
What O
I O
have O
said O
I O
have O
said O
merely O
as O
a O
warning. O
To O
do O
so O
is O
no O
more O
than O
my O
right." O
When O
returning O
home O
with O
the O
children O
before O
luncheon, O
I O
met O
a O
cavalcade O
of O
our O
party O
riding O
to O
view O
some O
ruins. O
Two O
splendid O
carriages, O
magnificently O
horsed, O
with O
Mlle. O
Blanche, O
Maria PERSON
Philipovna, O
and O
Polina PERSON
Alexandrovna PERSON
in O
one O
of O
them, O
and O
the O
Frenchman, O
the O
Englishman, O
and O
the O
General O
in O
attendance O
on O
horseback! O
The O
passers-by O
stopped O
to O
stare O
at O
them, O
for O
the O
effect O
was O
splendid--the O
General O
could O
not O
have O
improved O
upon O
it. O
I O
calculated O
that, O
with O
the O
4000 O
francs O
which O
I O
had O
brought O
with O
me, O
added O
to O
what O
my O
patrons O
seemed O
already O
to O
have O
acquired, O
the O
party O
must O
be O
in O
possession O
of O
at O
least O
7000 O
or O
8000 O
francs--though O
that O
would O
be O
none O
too O
much O
for O
Mlle. O
Blanche, O
who, O
with O
her O
mother O
and O
the O
Frenchman, O
was O
also O
lodging O
in O
our O
hotel. O
The O
latter O
gentleman O
was O
called O
by O
the O
lacqueys O
"Monsieur O
le O
Comte," O
and O
Mlle. O
Blanche's O
mother O
was O
dubbed O
"Madame O
la O
Comtesse." O
Perhaps O
in O
very O
truth O
they O
WERE O
"Comte O
et O
Comtesse." O
I O
knew O
that O
"Monsieur O
le O
Comte" O
would O
take O
no O
notice O
of O
me O
when O
we O
met O
at O
dinner, O
as O
also O
that O
the O
General O
would O
not O
dream O
of O
introducing O
us, O
nor O
of O
recommending O
me O
to O
the O
"Comte." O
However, O
the O
latter O
had O
lived O
awhile O
in O
Russia, O
and O
knew O
that O
the O
person O
referred O
to O
as O
an O
"uchitel" O
is O
never O
looked O
upon O
as O
a O
bird O
of O
fine O
feather. O
Of O
course, O
strictly O
speaking, O
he O
knew O
me; O
but O
I O
was O
an O
uninvited O
guest O
at O
the O
luncheon--the O
General O
had O
forgotten O
to O
arrange O
otherwise, O
or O
I O
should O
have O
been O
dispatched O
to O
dine O
at O
the O
table O
d'hote. O
Nevertheless, O
I O
presented O
myself O
in O
such O
guise O
that O
the O
General O
looked O
at O
me O
with O
a O
touch O
of O
approval; O
and, O
though O
the O
good O
Maria PERSON
Philipovna PERSON
was O
for O
showing O
me O
my O
place, O
the O
fact O
of O
my O
having O
previously O
met O
the O
Englishman, O
Mr. O
Astley, O
saved O
me, O
and O
thenceforward O
I O
figured O
as O
one O
of O
the O
company. O
This O
strange O
Englishman O
I O
had O
met O
first O
in O
Prussia, O
where O
we O
had O
happened O
to O
sit O
vis-a-vis O
in O
a O
railway O
train O
in O
which O
I O
was O
travelling O
to O
overtake O
our O
party; O
while, O
later, O
I O
had O
run O
across O
him O
in O
France, O
and O
again O
in O
Switzerland--twice O
within O
the O
space O
of O
two O
weeks! O
To O
think, O
therefore, O
that O
I O
should O
suddenly O
encounter O
him O
again O
here, O
in O
Roulettenberg! O
Never O
in O
my O
life O
had O
I O
known O
a O
more O
retiring O
man, O
for O
he O
was O
shy O
to O
the O
pitch O
of O
imbecility, O
yet O
well O
aware O
of O
the O
fact O
(for O
he O
was O
no O
fool). O
At O
the O
same O
time, O
he O
was O
a O
gentle, O
amiable O
sort O
of O
an O
individual, O
and, O
even O
on O
our O
first O
encounter O
in O
Prussia LOCATION
I O
had O
contrived O
to O
draw O
him O
out, O
and O
he O
had O
told O
me O
that O
he O
had O
just O
been O
to O
the O
North O
Cape, O
and O
was O
now O
anxious O
to O
visit O
the O
fair O
at O
Nizhni O
Novgorod. O
How O
he O
had O
come O
to O
make O
the O
General's O
acquaintance O
I O
do O
not O
know, O
but, O
apparently, O
he O
was O
much O
struck O
with O
Polina. O
Also, O
he O
was O
delighted O
that O
I O
should O
sit O
next O
him O
at O
table, O
for O
he O
appeared O
to O
look O
upon O
me O
as O
his O
bosom O
friend. O
During O
the O
meal O
the O
Frenchman O
was O
in O
great O
feather: O
he O
was O
discursive O
and O
pompous O
to O
every O
one. O
In O
Moscow LOCATION
too, O
I O
remembered, O
he O
had O
blown O
a O
great O
many O
bubbles. O
Interminably O
he O
discoursed O
on O
finance O
and O
Russian O
politics, O
and O
though, O
at O
times, O
the O
General O
made O
feints O
to O
contradict O
him, O
he O
did O
so O
humbly, O
and O
as O
though O
wishing O
not O
wholly O
to O
lose O
sight O
of O
his O
own O
dignity. O
For O
myself, O
I O
was O
in O
a O
curious O
frame O
of O
mind. O
Even O
before O
luncheon O
was O
half O
finished O
I O
had O
asked O
myself O
the O
old, O
eternal O
question: O
"WHY O
do O
I O
continue O
to O
dance O
attendance O
upon O
the O
General, O
instead O
of O
having O
left O
him O
and O
his O
family O
long O
ago?" O
Every O
now O
and O
then O
I O
would O
glance O
at O
Polina O
Alexandrovna, O
but O
she O
paid O
me O
no O
attention; O
until O
eventually O
I O
became O
so O
irritated O
that O
I O
decided O
to O
play O
the O
boor. O
First O
of O
all O
I O
suddenly, O
and O
for O
no O
reason O
whatever, O
plunged O
loudly O
and O
gratuitously O
into O
the O
general O
conversation. O
Above O
everything O
I O
wanted O
to O
pick O
a O
quarrel O
with O
the O
Frenchman; O
and, O
with O
that O
end O
in O
view O
I O
turned O
to O
the O
General, O
and O
exclaimed O
in O
an O
overbearing O
sort O
of O
way--indeed, O
I O
think O
that O
I O
actually O
interrupted O
him--that O
that O
summer O
it O
had O
been O
almost O
impossible O
for O
a O
Russian LOCATION
to O
dine O
anywhere O
at O
tables O
d'hote. O
The O
General O
bent O
upon O
me O
a O
glance O
of O
astonishment. O
"If O
one O
is O
a O
man O
of O
self-respect," O
I O
went O
on, O
"one O
risks O
abuse O
by O
so O
doing, O
and O
is O
forced O
to O
put O
up O
with O
insults O
of O
every O
kind. O
Both O
at O
Paris LOCATION
and O
on O
the O
Rhine, O
and O
even O
in O
Switzerland--there O
are O
so O
many O
Poles, O
with O
their O
sympathisers, O
the O
French, O
at O
these O
tables O
d'hote O
that O
one O
cannot O
get O
a O
word O
in O
edgeways O
if O
one O
happens O
only O
to O
be O
a O
Russian." O
This O
I O
said O
in O
French. O
The O
General O
eyed O
me O
doubtfully, O
for O
he O
did O
not O
know O
whether O
to O
be O
angry O
or O
merely O
to O
feel O
surprised O
that O
I O
should O
so O
far O
forget O
myself. O
"Of O
course, O
one O
always O
learns O
SOMETHING O
EVERYWHERE," O
said O
the O
Frenchman O
in O
a O
careless, O
contemptuous O
sort O
of O
tone. O
"In O
Paris, O
too, O
I O
had O
a O
dispute O
with O
a O
Pole," O
I O
continued, O
"and O
then O
with O
a O
French O
officer O
who O
supported O
him. O
After O
that O
a O
section O
of O
the O
Frenchmen O
present O
took O
my O
part. O
They O
did O
so O
as O
soon O
as O
I O
told O
them O
the O
story O
of O
how O
once O
I O
threatened O
to O
spit O
into O
Monsignor's O
coffee." O
"To O
spit O
into O
it?" O
the O
General O
inquired O
with O
grave O
disapproval O
in O
his O
tone, O
and O
a O
stare, O
of O
astonishment, O
while O
the O
Frenchman O
looked O
at O
me O
unbelievingly. O
"Just O
so," O
I O
replied. O
"You O
must O
know O
that, O
on O
one O
occasion, O
when, O
for O
two O
days, O
I O
had O
felt O
certain O
that O
at O
any O
moment O
I O
might O
have O
to O
depart O
for O
Rome LOCATION
on O
business, O
I O
repaired O
to O
the O
Embassy O
of O
the O
Holy O
See O
in O
Paris, O
to O
have O
my O
passport O
visaed. O
There O
I O
encountered O
a O
sacristan O
of O
about O
fifty, O
and O
a O
man O
dry O
and O
cold O
of O
mien. O
After O
listening O
politely, O
but O
with O
great O
reserve, O
to O
my O
account O
of O
myself, O
this O
sacristan O
asked O
me O
to O
wait O
a O
little. O
I O
was O
in O
a O
great O
hurry O
to O
depart, O
but O
of O
course O
I O
sat O
down, O
pulled O
out O
a O
copy O
of O
L'Opinion O
Nationale, O
and O
fell O
to O
reading O
an O
extraordinary O
piece O
of O
invective O
against O
Russia LOCATION
which O
it O
happened O
to O
contain. O
As O
I O
was O
thus O
engaged O
I O
heard O
some O
one O
enter O
an O
adjoining O
room O
and O
ask O
for O
Monsignor; O
after O
which O
I O
saw O
the O
sacristan O
make O
a O
low O
bow O
to O
the O
visitor, O
and O
then O
another O
bow O
as O
the O
visitor O
took O
his O
leave. O
I O
ventured O
to O
remind O
the O
good O
man O
of O
my O
own O
business O
also; O
whereupon, O
with O
an O
expression O
of, O
if O
anything, O
increased O
dryness, O
he O
again O
asked O
me O
to O
wait. O
Soon O
a O
third O
visitor O
arrived O
who, O
like O
myself, O
had O
come O
on O
business O
(he O
was O
an O
Austrian O
of O
some O
sort); O
and O
as O
soon O
as O
ever O
he O
had O
stated O
his O
errand O
he O
was O
conducted O
upstairs! O
This O
made O
me O
very O
angry. O
I O
rose, O
approached O
the O
sacristan, O
and O
told O
him O
that, O
since O
Monsignor O
was O
receiving O
callers, O
his O
lordship O
might O
just O
as O
well O
finish O
off O
my O
affair O
as O
well. O
Upon O
this O
the O
sacristan O
shrunk O
back O
in O
astonishment. O
It O
simply O
passed O
his O
understanding O
that O
any O
insignificant O
Russian O
should O
dare O
to O
compare O
himself O
with O
other O
visitors O
of O
Monsignor's! O
In O
a O
tone O
of O
the O
utmost O
effrontery, O
as O
though O
he O
were O
delighted O
to O
have O
a O
chance O
of O
insulting O
me, O
he O
looked O
me O
up O
and O
down, O
and O
then O
said: O
"Do O
you O
suppose O
that O
Monsignor O
is O
going O
to O
put O
aside O
his O
coffee O
for O
YOU?" O
But O
I O
only O
cried O
the O
louder: O
"Let O
me O
tell O
you O
that O
I O
am O
going O
to O
SPIT O
into O
that O
coffee! O
Yes, O
and O
if O
you O
do O
not O
get O
me O
my O
passport O
visaed O
this O
very O
minute, O
I O
shall O
take O
it O
to O
Monsignor O
myself." O
"What? O
While O
he O
is O
engaged O
with O
a O
Cardinal?" O
screeched O
the O
sacristan, O
again O
shrinking O
back O
in O
horror. O
Then, O
rushing O
to O
the O
door, O
he O
spread O
out O
his O
arms O
as O
though O
he O
would O
rather O
die O
than O
let O
me O
enter. O
Thereupon O
I O
declared O
that O
I O
was O
a O
heretic O
and O
a O
barbarian--"Je O
suis O
heretique O
et O
barbare," O
I O
said, O
"and O
that O
these O
archbishops O
and O
cardinals O
and O
monsignors, O
and O
the O
rest O
of O
them, O
meant O
nothing O
at O
all O
to O
me. O
In O
a O
word, O
I O
showed O
him O
that O
I O
was O
not O
going O
to O
give O
way. O
He O
looked O
at O
me O
with O
an O
air O
of O
infinite O
resentment. O
Then O
he O
snatched O
up O
my O
passport, O
and O
departed O
with O
it O
upstairs. O
A O
minute O
later O
the O
passport O
had O
been O
visaed! O
Here O
it O
is O
now, O
if O
you O
care O
to O
see O
it,"--and O
I O
pulled O
out O
the O
document, O
and O
exhibited O
the O
Roman O
visa. O
"But--" O
the O
General O
began. O
"What O
really O
saved O
you O
was O
the O
fact O
that O
you O
proclaimed O
yourself O
a O
heretic O
and O
a O
barbarian," O
remarked O
the O
Frenchman O
with O
a O
smile. O
"Cela O
n'etait O
pas O
si O
bete." O
"But O
is O
that O
how O
Russian O
subjects O
ought O
to O
be O
treated? O
Why, O
when O
they O
settle O
here O
they O
dare O
not O
utter O
even O
a O
word--they O
are O
ready O
even O
to O
deny O
the O
fact O
that O
they O
are O
Russians! O
At O
all O
events, O
at O
my O
hotel O
in O
Paris LOCATION
I O
received O
far O
more O
attention O
from O
the O
company O
after O
I O
had O
told O
them O
about O
the O
fracas O
with O
the O
sacristan. O
A O
fat O
Polish O
nobleman, O
who O
had O
been O
the O
most O
offensive O
of O
all O
who O
were O
present O
at O
the O
table O
d'hote, O
at O
once O
went O
upstairs, O
while O
some O
of O
the O
Frenchmen O
were O
simply O
disgusted O
when O
I O
told O
them O
that O
two O
years O
ago O
I O
had O
encountered O
a O
man O
at O
whom, O
in O
1812, O
a O
French O
'hero' O
fired O
for O
the O
mere O
fun O
of O
discharging O
his O
musket. O
That O
man O
was O
then O
a O
boy O
of O
ten O
and O
his O
family O
are O
still O
residing O
in O
Moscow." O
"Impossible!" O
the O
Frenchman O
spluttered. O
"No O
French O
soldier O
would O
fire O
at O
a O
child!" O
"Nevertheless O
the O
incident O
was O
as O
I O
say," O
I O
replied. O
"A O
very O
respected O
ex-captain O
told O
me O
the O
story, O
and O
I O
myself O
could O
see O
the O
scar O
left O
on O
his O
cheek." O
The O
Frenchman O
then O
began O
chattering O
volubly, O
and O
the O
General O
supported O
him; O
but O
I O
recommended O
the O
former O
to O
read, O
for O
example, O
extracts O
from O
the O
memoirs O
of O
General O
Perovski, O
who, O
in O
1812, O
was O
a O
prisoner O
in O
the O
hands O
of O
the O
French. O
Finally O
Maria PERSON
Philipovna PERSON
said O
something O
to O
interrupt O
the O
conversation. O
The O
General O
was O
furious O
with O
me O
for O
having O
started O
the O
altercation O
with O
the O
Frenchman. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
Mr. O
Astley PERSON
seemed O
to O
take O
great O
pleasure O
in O
my O
brush O
with O
Monsieur, O
and, O
rising O
from O
the O
table, O
proposed O
that O
we O
should O
go O
and O
have O
a O
drink O
together. O
The O
same O
afternoon, O
at O
four O
o'clock, O
I O
went O
to O
have O
my O
customary O
talk O
with O
Polina PERSON
Alexandrovna; O
and, O
the O
talk O
soon O
extended O
to O
a O
stroll. O
We O
entered O
the O
Park, O
and O
approached O
the O
Casino, O
where O
Polina PERSON
seated O
herself O
upon O
a O
bench O
near O
the O
fountain, O
and O
sent O
Nadia PERSON
away O
to O
a O
little O
distance O
to O
play O
with O
some O
other O
children. O
Mischa PERSON
also O
I O
dispatched O
to O
play O
by O
the O
fountain, O
and O
in O
this O
fashion O
we--that O
is O
to O
say, O
Polina PERSON
and O
myself--contrived O
to O
find O
ourselves O
alone. O
Of O
course, O
we O
began O
by O
talking O
on O
business O
matters. O
Polina PERSON
seemed O
furious O
when O
I O
handed O
her O
only O
700 O
gulden, O
for O
she O
had O
thought O
to O
receive O
from O
Paris, O
as O
the O
proceeds O
of O
the O
pledging O
of O
her O
diamonds, O
at O
least O
2000 O
gulden, O
or O
even O
more. O
"Come O
what O
may, O
I O
MUST O
have O
money," O
she O
said. O
"And O
get O
it O
somehow O
I O
will--otherwise O
I O
shall O
be O
ruined." O
I O
asked O
her O
what O
had O
happened O
during O
my O
absence. O
"Nothing; O
except O
that O
two O
pieces O
of O
news O
have O
reached O
us O
from O
St. LOCATION
Petersburg. LOCATION
In O
the O
first O
place, O
my O
grandmother O
is O
very O
ill, O
and O
unlikely O
to O
last O
another O
couple O
of O
days. O
We O
had O
this O
from O
Timothy PERSON
Petrovitch PERSON
himself, O
and O
he O
is O
a O
reliable O
person. O
Every O
moment O
we O
are O
expecting O
to O
receive O
news O
of O
the O
end." O
"All O
of O
you O
are O
on O
the O
tiptoe O
of O
expectation?" O
I O
queried. O
"Of O
course--all O
of O
us, O
and O
every O
minute O
of O
the O
day. O
For O
a O
year-and-a-half O
now O
we O
have O
been O
looking O
for O
this." O
"Looking O
for O
it?" O
"Yes, O
looking O
for O
it. O
I O
am O
not O
her O
blood O
relation, O
you O
know--I O
am O
merely O
the O
General's O
step-daughter. O
Yet O
I O
am O
certain O
that O
the O
old O
lady O
has O
remembered O
me O
in O
her O
will." O
"Yes, O
I O
believe O
that O
you O
WILL O
come O
in O
for O
a O
good O
deal," O
I O
said O
with O
some O
assurance. O
"Yes, O
for O
she O
is O
fond O
of O
me. O
But O
how O
come O
you O
to O
think O
so?" O
I O
answered O
this O
question O
with O
another O
one. O
"That O
Marquis PERSON
of O
yours," O
I O
said, O
"--is O
HE O
also O
familiar O
with O
your O
family O
secrets?" O
"And O
why O
are O
you O
yourself O
so O
interested O
in O
them?" O
was O
her O
retort O
as O
she O
eyed O
me O
with O
dry O
grimness. O
"Never O
mind. O
If O
I O
am O
not O
mistaken, O
the O
General O
has O
succeeded O
in O
borrowing O
money O
of O
the O
Marquis." O
"It O
may O
be O
so." O
"Is O
it O
likely O
that O
the O
Marquis PERSON
would O
have O
lent O
the O
money O
if O
he O
had O
not O
known O
something O
or O
other O
about O
your O
grandmother? O
Did O
you O
notice, O
too, O
that O
three O
times O
during O
luncheon, O
when O
speaking O
of O
her, O
he O
called O
her O
'La O
Baboulenka'? O
[Dear O
little O
Grandmother]. O
What O
loving, O
friendly O
behaviour, O
to O
be O
sure!" O
"Yes, O
that O
is O
true. O
As O
soon O
as O
ever O
he O
learnt O
that O
I O
was O
likely O
to O
inherit O
something O
from O
her O
he O
began O
to O
pay O
me O
his O
addresses. O
I O
thought O
you O
ought O
to O
know O
that." O
"Then O
he O
has O
only O
just O
begun O
his O
courting? O
Why, O
I O
thought O
he O
had O
been O
doing O
so O
a O
long O
while!" O
"You O
KNOW O
he O
has O
not," O
retorted O
Polina PERSON
angrily. O
"But O
where O
on O
earth O
did O
you O
pick O
up O
this O
Englishman?" O
She O
said O
this O
after O
a O
pause. O
"I O
KNEW O
you O
would O
ask O
about O
him!" O
Whereupon O
I O
told O
her O
of O
my O
previous O
encounters O
with O
Astley PERSON
while O
travelling. O
"He O
is O
very O
shy," O
I O
said, O
"and O
susceptible. O
Also, O
he O
is O
in O
love O
with O
you.--" O
"Yes, O
he O
is O
in O
love O
with O
me," O
she O
replied. O
"And O
he O
is O
ten O
times O
richer O
than O
the O
Frenchman. O
In O
fact, O
what O
does O
the O
Frenchman O
possess? O
To O
me O
it O
seems O
at O
least O
doubtful O
that O
he O
possesses O
anything O
at O
all." O
"Oh, O
no, O
there O
is O
no O
doubt O
about O
it. O
He O
does O
possess O
some O
chateau O
or O
other. O
Last O
night O
the O
General O
told O
me O
that O
for O
certain. O
NOW O
are O
you O
satisfied?" O
"Nevertheless, O
in O
your O
place O
I O
should O
marry O
the O
Englishman." O
"And O
why?" O
asked O
Polina. O
"Because, O
though O
the O
Frenchman O
is O
the O
handsomer O
of O
the O
two, O
he O
is O
also O
the O
baser; O
whereas O
the O
Englishman O
is O
not O
only O
a O
man O
of O
honour, O
but O
ten O
times O
the O
wealthier O
of O
the O
pair." O
"Yes? O
But O
then O
the O
Frenchman O
is O
a O
marquis, O
and O
the O
cleverer O
of O
the O
two," O
remarked O
Polina PERSON
imperturbably. O
"Is O
that O
so?" O
I O
repeated. O
"Yes; O
absolutely." O
Polina PERSON
was O
not O
at O
all O
pleased O
at O
my O
questions; O
I O
could O
see O
that O
she O
was O
doing O
her O
best O
to O
irritate O
me O
with O
the O
brusquerie O
of O
her O
answers. O
But O
I O
took O
no O
notice O
of O
this. O
"It O
amuses O
me O
to O
see O
you O
grow O
angry," O
she O
continued. O
"However, O
inasmuch O
as O
I O
allow O
you O
to O
indulge O
in O
these O
questions O
and O
conjectures, O
you O
ought O
to O
pay O
me O
something O
for O
the O
privilege." O
"I O
consider O
that O
I O
have O
a O
perfect O
right O
to O
put O
these O
questions O
to O
you," O
was O
my O
calm O
retort; O
"for O
the O
reason O
that O
I O
am O
ready O
to O
pay O
for O
them, O
and O
also O
care O
little O
what O
becomes O
of O
me." O
Polina PERSON
giggled. O
"Last O
time O
you O
told O
me--when O
on O
the O
Shlangenberg--that O
at O
a O
word O
from O
me O
you O
would O
be O
ready O
to O
jump O
down O
a O
thousand O
feet O
into O
the O
abyss. O
Some O
day O
I O
may O
remind O
you O
of O
that O
saying, O
in O
order O
to O
see O
if O
you O
will O
be O
as O
good O
as O
your O
word. O
Yes, O
you O
may O
depend O
upon O
it O
that O
I O
shall O
do O
so. O
I O
hate O
you O
because O
I O
have O
allowed O
you O
to O
go O
to O
such O
lengths, O
and O
I O
also O
hate O
you O
and O
still O
more--because O
you O
are O
so O
necessary O
to O
me. O
For O
the O
time O
being O
I O
want O
you, O
so O
I O
must O
keep O
you." O
Then O
she O
made O
a O
movement O
to O
rise. O
Her O
tone O
had O
sounded O
very O
angry. O
Indeed, O
of O
late O
her O
talks O
with O
me O
had O
invariably O
ended O
on O
a O
note O
of O
temper O
and O
irritation--yes, O
of O
real O
temper. O
"May O
I O
ask O
you O
who O
is O
this O
Mlle. O
Blanche?" O
I O
inquired O
(since O
I O
did O
not O
wish O
Polina PERSON
to O
depart O
without O
an O
explanation). O
"You O
KNOW O
who O
she O
is--just O
Mlle. O
Blanche. O
Nothing O
further O
has O
transpired. O
Probably O
she O
will O
soon O
be O
Madame O
General--that O
is O
to O
say, O
if O
the O
rumours O
that O
Grandmamma PERSON
is O
nearing O
her O
end O
should O
prove O
true. O
Mlle. O
Blanche, O
with O
her O
mother O
and O
her O
cousin, O
the O
Marquis, O
know O
very O
well O
that, O
as O
things O
now O
stand, O
we O
are O
ruined." O
"And O
is O
the O
General O
at O
last O
in O
love?" O
"That O
has O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
it. O
Listen O
to O
me. O
Take O
these O
700 O
florins, O
and O
go O
and O
play O
roulette O
with O
them. O
Win O
as O
much O
for O
me O
as O
you O
can, O
for O
I O
am O
badly O
in O
need O
of O
money." O
So O
saying, O
she O
called O
Nadia PERSON
back O
to O
her O
side, O
and O
entered O
the O
Casino, O
where O
she O
joined O
the O
rest O
of O
our O
party. O
For O
myself, O
I O
took, O
in O
musing O
astonishment, O
the O
first O
path O
to O
the O
left. O
Something O
had O
seemed O
to O
strike O
my O
brain O
when O
she O
told O
me O
to O
go O
and O
play O
roulette. O
Strangely O
enough, O
that O
something O
had O
also O
seemed O
to O
make O
me O
hesitate, O
and O
to O
set O
me O
analysing O
my O
feelings O
with O
regard O
to O
her. O
In O
fact, O
during O
the O
two O
weeks O
of O
my O
absence O
I O
had O
felt O
far O
more O
at O
my O
ease O
than O
I O
did O
now, O
on O
the O
day O
of O
my O
return; O
although, O
while O
travelling, O
I O
had O
moped O
like O
an O
imbecile, O
rushed O
about O
like O
a O
man O
in O
a O
fever, O
and O
actually O
beheld O
her O
in O
my O
dreams. O
Indeed, O
on O
one O
occasion O
(this O
happened O
in O
Switzerland, O
when O
I O
was O
asleep O
in O
the O
train) O
I O
had O
spoken O
aloud O
to O
her, O
and O
set O
all O
my O
fellow-travellers O
laughing. O
Again, O
therefore, O
I O
put O
to O
myself O
the O
question: O
"Do O
I, O
or O
do O
I O
not O
love O
her?" O
and O
again O
I O
could O
return O
myself O
no O
answer O
or, O
rather, O
for O
the O
hundredth O
time O
I O
told O
myself O
that O
I O
detested O
her. O
Yes, O
I O
detested O
her; O
there O
were O
moments O
(more O
especially O
at O
the O
close O
of O
our O
talks O
together) O
when O
I O
would O
gladly O
have O
given O
half O
my O
life O
to O
have O
strangled O
her! O
I O
swear O
that, O
had O
there, O
at O
such O
moments, O
been O
a O
sharp O
knife O
ready O
to O
my O
hand, O
I O
would O
have O
seized O
that O
knife O
with O
pleasure, O
and O
plunged O
it O
into O
her O
breast. O
Yet O
I O
also O
swear O
that O
if, O
on O
the O
Shlangenberg, O
she O
had O
REALLY O
said O
to O
me, O
"Leap O
into O
that O
abyss," O
I O
should O
have O
leapt O
into O
it, O
and O
with O
equal O
pleasure. O
Yes, O
this O
I O
knew O
well. O
One O
way O
or O
the O
other, O
the O
thing O
must O
soon O
be O
ended. O
She, O
too, O
knew O
it O
in O
some O
curious O
way; O
the O
thought O
that O
I O
was O
fully O
conscious O
of O
her O
inaccessibility, O
and O
of O
the O
impossibility O
of O
my O
ever O
realising O
my O
dreams, O
afforded O
her, O
I O
am O
certain, O
the O
keenest O
possible O
pleasure. O
Otherwise, O
is O
it O
likely O
that O
she, O
the O
cautious O
and O
clever O
woman O
that O
she O
was, O
would O
have O
indulged O
in O
this O
familiarity O
and O
openness O
with O
me? O
Hitherto O
(I O
concluded) O
she O
had O
looked O
upon O
me O
in O
the O
same O
light O
that O
the O
old O
Empress O
did O
upon O
her O
servant--the O
Empress O
who O
hesitated O
not O
to O
unrobe O
herself O
before O
her O
slave, O
since O
she O
did O
not O
account O
a O
slave O
a O
man. O
Yes, O
often O
Polina PERSON
must O
have O
taken O
me O
for O
something O
less O
than O
a O
man!" O
Still, O
she O
had O
charged O
me O
with O
a O
commission--to O
win O
what O
I O
could O
at O
roulette. O
Yet O
all O
the O
time O
I O
could O
not O
help O
wondering O
WHY O
it O
was O
so O
necessary O
for O
her O
to O
win O
something, O
and O
what O
new O
schemes O
could O
have O
sprung O
to O
birth O
in O
her O
ever-fertile O
brain. O
A O
host O
of O
new O
and O
unknown O
factors O
seemed O
to O
have O
arisen O
during O
the O
last O
two O
weeks. O
Well, O
it O
behoved O
me O
to O
divine O
them, O
and O
to O
probe O
them, O
and O
that O
as O
soon O
as O
possible. O
Yet O
not O
now: O
at O
the O
present O
moment O
I O
must O
repair O
to O
the O
roulette-table. O
II O
I O
confess O
I O
did O
not O
like O
it. O
Although O
I O
had O
made O
up O
my O
mind O
to O
play, O
I O
felt O
averse O
to O
doing O
so O
on O
behalf O
of O
some O
one O
else. O
In O
fact, O
it O
almost O
upset O
my O
balance, O
and O
I O
entered O
the O
gaming O
rooms O
with O
an O
angry O
feeling O
at O
my O
heart. O
At O
first O
glance O
the O
scene O
irritated O
me. O
Never O
at O
any O
time O
have O
I O
been O
able O
to O
bear O
the O
flunkeyishness O
which O
one O
meets O
in O
the O
Press O
of O
the O
world O
at O
large, O
but O
more O
especially O
in O
that O
of O
Russia, O
where, O
almost O
every O
evening, O
journalists O
write O
on O
two O
subjects O
in O
particular O
namely, O
on O
the O
splendour O
and O
luxury O
of O
the O
casinos O
to O
be O
found O
in O
the O
Rhenish O
towns, O
and O
on O
the O
heaps O
of O
gold O
which O
are O
daily O
to O
be O
seen O
lying O
on O
their O
tables. O
Those O
journalists O
are O
not O
paid O
for O
doing O
so: O
they O
write O
thus O
merely O
out O
of O
a O
spirit O
of O
disinterested O
complaisance. O
For O
there O
is O
nothing O
splendid O
about O
the O
establishments O
in O
question; O
and, O
not O
only O
are O
there O
no O
heaps O
of O
gold O
to O
be O
seen O
lying O
on O
their O
tables, O
but O
also O
there O
is O
very O
little O
money O
to O
be O
seen O
at O
all. O
Of O
course, O
during O
the O
season, O
some O
madman O
or O
another O
may O
make O
his O
appearance--generally O
an O
Englishman, O
or O
an O
Asiatic, O
or O
a O
Turk--and O
(as O
had O
happened O
during O
the O
summer O
of O
which O
I O
write) O
win O
or O
lose O
a O
great O
deal; O
but, O
as O
regards O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
crowd, O
it O
plays O
only O
for O
petty O
gulden, O
and O
seldom O
does O
much O
wealth O
figure O
on O
the O
board. O
When, O
on O
the O
present O
occasion, O
I O
entered O
the O
gaming-rooms O
(for O
the O
first O
time O
in O
my O
life), O
it O
was O
several O
moments O
before O
I O
could O
even O
make O
up O
my O
mind O
to O
play. O
For O
one O
thing, O
the O
crowd O
oppressed O
me. O
Had O
I O
been O
playing O
for O
myself, O
I O
think O
I O
should O
have O
left O
at O
once, O
and O
never O
have O
embarked O
upon O
gambling O
at O
all, O
for O
I O
could O
feel O
my O
heart O
beginning O
to O
beat, O
and O
my O
heart O
was O
anything O
but O
cold-blooded. O
Also, O
I O
knew, O
I O
had O
long O
ago O
made O
up O
my O
mind, O
that O
never O
should O
I O
depart O
from O
Roulettenberg LOCATION
until O
some O
radical, O
some O
final, O
change O
had O
taken O
place O
in O
my O
fortunes. O
Thus, O
it O
must O
and O
would O
be. O
However O
ridiculous O
it O
may O
seem O
to O
you O
that O
I O
was O
expecting O
to O
win O
at O
roulette, O
I O
look O
upon O
the O
generally O
accepted O
opinion O
concerning O
the O
folly O
and O
the O
grossness O
of O
hoping O
to O
win O
at O
gambling O
as O
a O
thing O
even O
more O
absurd. O
For O
why O
is O
gambling O
a O
whit O
worse O
than O
any O
other O
method O
of O
acquiring O
money? O
How, O
for O
instance, O
is O
it O
worse O
than O
trade? O
True, O
out O
of O
a O
hundred O
persons, O
only O
one O
can O
win; O
yet O
what O
business O
is O
that O
of O
yours O
or O
of O
mine? O
At O
all O
events, O
I O
confined O
myself O
at O
first O
simply O
to O
looking O
on, O
and O
decided O
to O
attempt O
nothing O
serious. O
Indeed, O
I O
felt O
that, O
if O
I O
began O
to O
do O
anything O
at O
all, O
I O
should O
do O
it O
in O
an O
absent-minded, O
haphazard O
sort O
of O
way--of O
that O
I O
felt O
certain. O
Also, O
it O
behoved O
me O
to O
learn O
the O
game O
itself; O
since, O
despite O
a O
thousand O
descriptions O
of O
roulette O
which O
I O
had O
read O
with O
ceaseless O
avidity, O
I O
knew O
nothing O
of O
its O
rules, O
and O
had O
never O
even O
seen O
it O
played. O
In O
the O
first O
place, O
everything O
about O
it O
seemed O
to O
me O
so O
foul--so O
morally O
mean O
and O
foul. O
Yet O
I O
am O
not O
speaking O
of O
the O
hungry, O
restless O
folk O
who, O
by O
scores O
nay, O
even O
by O
hundreds--could O
be O
seen O
crowded O
around O
the O
gaming-tables. O
For O
in O
a O
desire O
to O
win O
quickly O
and O
to O
win O
much O
I O
can O
see O
nothing O
sordid; O
I O
have O
always O
applauded O
the O
opinion O
of O
a O
certain O
dead O
and O
gone, O
but O
cocksure, O
moralist O
who O
replied O
to O
the O
excuse O
that O
"one O
may O
always O
gamble O
moderately", O
by O
saying O
that O
to O
do O
so O
makes O
things O
worse, O
since, O
in O
that O
case, O
the O
profits O
too O
will O
always O
be O
moderate. O
Insignificant O
profits O
and O
sumptuous O
profits O
do O
not O
stand O
on O
the O
same O
footing. O
No, O
it O
is O
all O
a O
matter O
of O
proportion. O
What O
may O
seem O
a O
small O
sum O
to O
a O
Rothschild O
may O
seem O
a O
large O
sum O
to O
me, O
and O
it O
is O
not O
the O
fault O
of O
stakes O
or O
of O
winnings O
that O
everywhere O
men O
can O
be O
found O
winning, O
can O
be O
found O
depriving O
their O
fellows O
of O
something, O
just O
as O
they O
do O
at O
roulette. O
As O
to O
the O
question O
whether O
stakes O
and O
winnings O
are, O
in O
themselves, O
immoral O
is O
another O
question O
altogether, O
and O
I O
wish O
to O
express O
no O
opinion O
upon O
it. O
Yet O
the O
very O
fact O
that O
I O
was O
full O
of O
a O
strong O
desire O
to O
win O
caused O
this O
gambling O
for O
gain, O
in O
spite O
of O
its O
attendant O
squalor, O
to O
contain, O
if O
you O
will, O
something O
intimate, O
something O
sympathetic, O
to O
my O
eyes: O
for O
it O
is O
always O
pleasant O
to O
see O
men O
dispensing O
with O
ceremony, O
and O
acting O
naturally, O
and O
in O
an O
unbuttoned O
mood.... O
Yet, O
why O
should O
I O
so O
deceive O
myself? O
I O
could O
see O
that O
the O
whole O
thing O
was O
a O
vain O
and O
unreasoning O
pursuit; O
and O
what, O
at O
the O
first O
glance, O
seemed O
to O
me O
the O
ugliest O
feature O
in O
this O
mob O
of O
roulette O
players O
was O
their O
respect O
for O
their O
occupation--the O
seriousness, O
and O
even O
the O
humility, O
with O
which O
they O
stood O
around O
the O
gaming O
tables. O
Moreover, O
I O
had O
always O
drawn O
sharp O
distinctions O
between O
a O
game O
which O
is O
de O
mauvais O
genre O
and O
a O
game O
which O
is O
permissible O
to O
a O
decent O
man. O
In O
fact, O
there O
are O
two O
sorts O
of O
gaming--namely, O
the O
game O
of O
the O
gentleman O
and O
the O
game O
of O
the O
plebs--the O
game O
for O
gain, O
and O
the O
game O
of O
the O
herd. O
Herein, O
as O
said, O
I O
draw O
sharp O
distinctions. O
Yet O
how O
essentially O
base O
are O
the O
distinctions! O
For O
instance, O
a O
gentleman O
may O
stake, O
say, O
five O
or O
ten O
louis O
d'or--seldom O
more, O
unless O
he O
is O
a O
very O
rich O
man, O
when O
he O
may O
stake, O
say, O
a O
thousand O
francs; O
but, O
he O
must O
do O
this O
simply O
for O
the O
love O
of O
the O
game O
itself--simply O
for O
sport, O
simply O
in O
order O
to O
observe O
the O
process O
of O
winning O
or O
of O
losing, O
and, O
above O
all O
things, O
as O
a O
man O
who O
remains O
quite O
uninterested O
in O
the O
possibility O
of O
his O
issuing O
a O
winner. O
If O
he O
wins, O
he O
will O
be O
at O
liberty, O
perhaps, O
to O
give O
vent O
to O
a O
laugh, O
or O
to O
pass O
a O
remark O
on O
the O
circumstance O
to O
a O
bystander, O
or O
to O
stake O
again, O
or O
to O
double O
his O
stake; O
but, O
even O
this O
he O
must O
do O
solely O
out O
of O
curiosity, O
and O
for O
the O
pleasure O
of O
watching O
the O
play O
of O
chances O
and O
of O
calculations, O
and O
not O
because O
of O
any O
vulgar O
desire O
to O
win. O
In O
a O
word, O
he O
must O
look O
upon O
the O
gaming-table, O
upon O
roulette, O
and O
upon O
trente O
et O
quarante, O
as O
mere O
relaxations O
which O
have O
been O
arranged O
solely O
for O
his O
amusement. O
Of O
the O
existence O
of O
the O
lures O
and O
gains O
upon O
which O
the O
bank O
is O
founded O
and O
maintained O
he O
must O
profess O
to O
have O
not O
an O
inkling. O
Best O
of O
all, O
he O
ought O
to O
imagine O
his O
fellow-gamblers O
and O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
mob O
which O
stands O
trembling O
over O
a O
coin O
to O
be O
equally O
rich O
and O
gentlemanly O
with O
himself, O
and O
playing O
solely O
for O
recreation O
and O
pleasure. O
This O
complete O
ignorance O
of O
the O
realities, O
this O
innocent O
view O
of O
mankind, O
is O
what, O
in O
my O
opinion, O
constitutes O
the O
truly O
aristocratic. O
For O
instance, O
I O
have O
seen O
even O
fond O
mothers O
so O
far O
indulge O
their O
guileless, O
elegant O
daughters--misses O
of O
fifteen O
or O
sixteen--as O
to O
give O
them O
a O
few O
gold O
coins O
and O
teach O
them O
how O
to O
play; O
and O
though O
the O
young O
ladies O
may O
have O
won O
or O
have O
lost, O
they O
have O
invariably O
laughed, O
and O
departed O
as O
though O
they O
were O
well O
pleased. O
In O
the O
same O
way, O
I O
saw O
our O
General O
once O
approach O
the O
table O
in O
a O
stolid, O
important O
manner. O
A O
lacquey O
darted O
to O
offer O
him O
a O
chair, O
but O
the O
General O
did O
not O
even O
notice O
him. O
Slowly O
he O
took O
out O
his O
money O
bags, O
and O
slowly O
extracted O
300 O
francs O
in O
gold, O
which O
he O
staked O
on O
the O
black, O
and O
won. O
Yet O
he O
did O
not O
take O
up O
his O
winnings--he O
left O
them O
there O
on O
the O
table. O
Again O
the O
black O
turned O
up, O
and O
again O
he O
did O
not O
gather O
in O
what O
he O
had O
won; O
and O
when, O
in O
the O
third O
round, O
the O
RED O
turned O
up O
he O
lost, O
at O
a O
stroke, O
1200 O
francs. O
Yet O
even O
then O
he O
rose O
with O
a O
smile, O
and O
thus O
preserved O
his O
reputation; O
yet O
I O
knew O
that O
his O
money O
bags O
must O
be O
chafing O
his O
heart, O
as O
well O
as O
that, O
had O
the O
stake O
been O
twice O
or O
thrice O
as O
much O
again, O
he O
would O
still O
have O
restrained O
himself O
from O
venting O
his O
disappointment. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
I O
saw O
a O
Frenchman O
first O
win, O
and O
then O
lose, O
30,000 O
francs O
cheerfully, O
and O
without O
a O
murmur. O
Yes; O
even O
if O
a O
gentleman O
should O
lose O
his O
whole O
substance, O
he O
must O
never O
give O
way O
to O
annoyance. O
Money O
must O
be O
so O
subservient O
to O
gentility O
as O
never O
to O
be O
worth O
a O
thought. O
Of O
course, O
the O
SUPREMELY O
aristocratic O
thing O
is O
to O
be O
entirely O
oblivious O
of O
the O
mire O
of O
rabble, O
with O
its O
setting; O
but O
sometimes O
a O
reverse O
course O
may O
be O
aristocratic O
to O
remark, O
to O
scan, O
and O
even O
to O
gape O
at, O
the O
mob O
(for O
preference, O
through O
a O
lorgnette), O
even O
as O
though O
one O
were O
taking O
the O
crowd O
and O
its O
squalor O
for O
a O
sort O
of O
raree O
show O
which O
had O
been O
organised O
specially O
for O
a O
gentleman's O
diversion. O
Though O
one O
may O
be O
squeezed O
by O
the O
crowd, O
one O
must O
look O
as O
though O
one O
were O
fully O
assured O
of O
being O
the O
observer--of O
having O
neither O
part O
nor O
lot O
with O
the O
observed. O
At O
the O
same O
time, O
to O
stare O
fixedly O
about O
one O
is O
unbecoming; O
for O
that, O
again, O
is O
ungentlemanly, O
seeing O
that O
no O
spectacle O
is O
worth O
an O
open O
stare--are O
no O
spectacles O
in O
the O
world O
which O
merit O
from O
a O
gentleman O
too O
pronounced O
an O
inspection. O
However, O
to O
me O
personally O
the O
scene O
DID O
seem O
to O
be O
worth O
undisguised O
contemplation--more O
especially O
in O
view O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
I O
had O
come O
there O
not O
only O
to O
look O
at, O
but O
also O
to O
number O
myself O
sincerely O
and O
wholeheartedly O
with, O
the O
mob. O
As O
for O
my O
secret O
moral O
views, O
I O
had O
no O
room O
for O
them O
amongst O
my O
actual, O
practical O
opinions. O
Let O
that O
stand O
as O
written: O
I O
am O
writing O
only O
to O
relieve O
my O
conscience. O
Yet O
let O
me O
say O
also O
this: O
that O
from O
the O
first O
I O
have O
been O
consistent O
in O
having O
an O
intense O
aversion O
to O
any O
trial O
of O
my O
acts O
and O
thoughts O
by O
a O
moral O
standard. O
Another O
standard O
altogether O
has O
directed O
my O
life.... O
As O
a O
matter O
of O
fact, O
the O
mob O
was O
playing O
in O
exceedingly O
foul O
fashion. O
Indeed, O
I O
have O
an O
idea O
that O
sheer O
robbery O
was O
going O
on O
around O
that O
gaming-table. O
The O
croupiers O
who O
sat O
at O
the O
two O
ends O
of O
it O
had O
not O
only O
to O
watch O
the O
stakes, O
but O
also O
to O
calculate O
the O
game--an O
immense O
amount O
of O
work O
for O
two O
men! O
As O
for O
the O
crowd O
itself--well, O
it O
consisted O
mostly O
of O
Frenchmen. O
Yet O
I O
was O
not O
then O
taking O
notes O
merely O
in O
order O
to O
be O
able O
to O
give O
you O
a O
description O
of O
roulette, O
but O
in O
order O
to O
get O
my O
bearings O
as O
to O
my O
behaviour O
when O
I O
myself O
should O
begin O
to O
play. O
For O
example, O
I O
noticed O
that O
nothing O
was O
more O
common O
than O
for O
another's O
hand O
to O
stretch O
out O
and O
grab O
one's O
winnings O
whenever O
one O
had O
won. O
Then O
there O
would O
arise O
a O
dispute, O
and O
frequently O
an O
uproar; O
and O
it O
would O
be O
a O
case O
of O
"I O
beg O
of O
you O
to O
prove, O
and O
to O
produce O
witnesses O
to O
the O
fact, O
that O
the O
stake O
is O
yours." O
At O
first O
the O
proceedings O
were O
pure O
Greek O
to O
me. O
I O
could O
only O
divine O
and O
distinguish O
that O
stakes O
were O
hazarded O
on O
numbers, O
on O
"odd" O
or O
"even," O
and O
on O
colours. O
Polina's O
money O
I O
decided O
to O
risk, O
that O
evening, O
only O
to O
the O
amount O
of O
100 O
gulden. O
The O
thought O
that O
I O
was O
not O
going O
to O
play O
for O
myself O
quite O
unnerved O
me. O
It O
was O
an O
unpleasant O
sensation, O
and O
I O
tried O
hard O
to O
banish O
it. O
I O
had O
a O
feeling O
that, O
once O
I O
had O
begun O
to O
play O
for O
Polina, O
I O
should O
wreck O
my O
own O
fortunes. O
Also, O
I O
wonder O
if O
any O
one O
has O
EVER O
approached O
a O
gaming-table O
without O
falling O
an O
immediate O
prey O
to O
superstition? O
I O
began O
by O
pulling O
out O
fifty O
gulden, O
and O
staking O
them O
on O
"even." O
The O
wheel O
spun O
and O
stopped O
at O
13. O
I O
had O
lost! O
With O
a O
feeling O
like O
a O
sick O
qualm, O
as O
though O
I O
would O
like O
to O
make O
my O
way O
out O
of O
the O
crowd O
and O
go O
home, O
I O
staked O
another O
fifty O
gulden--this O
time O
on O
the O
red. O
The O
red O
turned O
up. O
Next O
time O
I O
staked O
the O
100 O
gulden O
just O
where O
they O
lay--and O
again O
the O
red O
turned O
up. O
Again O
I O
staked O
the O
whole O
sum, O
and O
again O
the O
red O
turned O
up. O
Clutching O
my O
400 O
gulden, O
I O
placed O
200 O
of O
them O
on O
twelve O
figures, O
to O
see O
what O
would O
come O
of O
it. O
The O
result O
was O
that O
the O
croupier O
paid O
me O
out O
three O
times O
my O
total O
stake! O
Thus O
from O
100 O
gulden O
my O
store O
had O
grown O
to O
800! O
Upon O
that O
such O
a O
curious, O
such O
an O
inexplicable, O
unwonted O
feeling O
overcame O
me O
that O
I O
decided O
to O
depart. O
Always O
the O
thought O
kept O
recurring O
to O
me O
that O
if O
I O
had O
been O
playing O
for O
myself O
alone O
I O
should O
never O
have O
had O
such O
luck. O
Once O
more O
I O
staked O
the O
whole O
800 O
gulden O
on O
the O
"even." O
The O
wheel O
stopped O
at O
4. O
I O
was O
paid O
out O
another O
800 O
gulden, O
and, O
snatching O
up O
my O
pile O
of O
1600, O
departed O
in O
search O
of O
Polina LOCATION
Alexandrovna. LOCATION
I O
found O
the O
whole O
party O
walking O
in O
the O
park, O
and O
was O
able O
to O
get O
an O
interview O
with O
her O
only O
after O
supper. O
This O
time O
the O
Frenchman O
was O
absent O
from O
the O
meal, O
and O
the O
General O
seemed O
to O
be O
in O
a O
more O
expansive O
vein. O
Among O
other O
things, O
he O
thought O
it O
necessary O
to O
remind O
me O
that O
he O
would O
be O
sorry O
to O
see O
me O
playing O
at O
the O
gaming-tables. O
In O
his O
opinion, O
such O
conduct O
would O
greatly O
compromise O
him--especially O
if O
I O
were O
to O
lose O
much. O
"And O
even O
if O
you O
were O
to O
WIN O
much O
I O
should O
be O
compromised," O
he O
added O
in O
a O
meaning O
sort O
of O
way. O
"Of O
course O
I O
have O
no O
RIGHT O
to O
order O
your O
actions, O
but O
you O
yourself O
will O
agree O
that..." O
As O
usual, O
he O
did O
not O
finish O
his O
sentence. O
I O
answered O
drily O
that O
I O
had O
very O
little O
money O
in O
my O
possession, O
and O
that, O
consequently, O
I O
was O
hardly O
in O
a O
position O
to O
indulge O
in O
any O
conspicuous O
play, O
even O
if O
I O
did O
gamble. O
At O
last, O
when O
ascending O
to O
my O
own O
room, O
I O
succeeded O
in O
handing O
Polina PERSON
her O
winnings, O
and O
told O
her O
that, O
next O
time, O
I O
should O
not O
play O
for O
her. O
"Why O
not?" O
she O
asked O
excitedly. O
"Because O
I O
wish O
to O
play O
FOR O
MYSELF," O
I O
replied O
with O
a O
feigned O
glance O
of O
astonishment. O
"That O
is O
my O
sole O
reason." O
"Then O
are O
you O
so O
certain O
that O
your O
roulette-playing O
will O
get O
us O
out O
of O
our O
difficulties?" O
she O
inquired O
with O
a O
quizzical O
smile. O
I O
said O
very O
seriously, O
"Yes," O
and O
then O
added: O
"Possibly O
my O
certainty O
about O
winning O
may O
seem O
to O
you O
ridiculous; O
yet, O
pray O
leave O
me O
in O
peace." O
Nonetheless O
she O
insisted O
that O
I O
ought O
to O
go O
halves O
with O
her O
in O
the O
day's O
winnings, O
and O
offered O
me O
800 O
gulden O
on O
condition O
that O
henceforth, O
I O
gambled O
only O
on O
those O
terms; O
but O
I O
refused O
to O
do O
so, O
once O
and O
for O
all--stating, O
as O
my O
reason, O
that O
I O
found O
myself O
unable O
to O
play O
on O
behalf O
of O
any O
one O
else, O
"I O
am O
not O
unwilling O
so O
to O
do," O
I O
added, O
"but O
in O
all O
probability O
I O
should O
lose." O
"Well, O
absurd O
though O
it O
be, O
I O
place O
great O
hopes O
on O
your O
playing O
of O
roulette," O
she O
remarked O
musingly; O
"wherefore, O
you O
ought O
to O
play O
as O
my O
partner O
and O
on O
equal O
shares; O
wherefore, O
of O
course, O
you O
will O
do O
as O
I O
wish." O
Then O
she O
left O
me O
without O
listening O
to O
any O
further O
protests O
on O
my O
part. O
III O
On O
the O
morrow O
she O
said O
not O
a O
word O
to O
me O
about O
gambling. O
In O
fact, O
she O
purposely O
avoided O
me, O
although O
her O
old O
manner O
to O
me O
had O
not O
changed: O
the O
same O
serene O
coolness O
was O
hers O
on O
meeting O
me--a O
coolness O
that O
was O
mingled O
even O
with O
a O
spice O
of O
contempt O
and O
dislike. O
In O
short, O
she O
was O
at O
no O
pains O
to O
conceal O
her O
aversion O
to O
me. O
That O
I O
could O
see O
plainly. O
Also, O
she O
did O
not O
trouble O
to O
conceal O
from O
me O
the O
fact O
that O
I O
was O
necessary O
to O
her, O
and O
that O
she O
was O
keeping O
me O
for O
some O
end O
which O
she O
had O
in O
view. O
Consequently O
there O
became O
established O
between O
us O
relations O
which, O
to O
a O
large O
extent, O
were O
incomprehensible O
to O
me, O
considering O
her O
general O
pride O
and O
aloofness. O
For O
example, O
although O
she O
knew O
that O
I O
was O
madly O
in O
love O
with O
her, O
she O
allowed O
me O
to O
speak O
to O
her O
of O
my O
passion O
(though O
she O
could O
not O
well O
have O
showed O
her O
contempt O
for O
me O
more O
than O
by O
permitting O
me, O
unhindered O
and O
unrebuked, O
to O
mention O
to O
her O
my O
love). O
"You O
see," O
her O
attitude O
expressed, O
"how O
little O
I O
regard O
your O
feelings, O
as O
well O
as O
how O
little O
I O
care O
for O
what O
you O
say O
to O
me, O
or O
for O
what O
you O
feel O
for O
me." O
Likewise, O
though O
she O
spoke O
as O
before O
concerning O
her O
affairs, O
it O
was O
never O
with O
complete O
frankness. O
In O
her O
contempt O
for O
me O
there O
were O
refinements. O
Although O
she O
knew O
well O
that O
I O
was O
aware O
of O
a O
certain O
circumstance O
in O
her O
life O
of O
something O
which O
might O
one O
day O
cause O
her O
trouble, O
she O
would O
speak O
to O
me O
about O
her O
affairs O
(whenever O
she O
had O
need O
of O
me O
for O
a O
given O
end) O
as O
though O
I O
were O
a O
slave O
or O
a O
passing O
acquaintance--yet O
tell O
them O
me O
only O
in O
so O
far O
as O
one O
would O
need O
to O
know O
them O
if O
one O
were O
going O
to O
be O
made O
temporary O
use O
of. O
Had O
I O
not O
known O
the O
whole O
chain O
of O
events, O
or O
had O
she O
not O
seen O
how O
much O
I O
was O
pained O
and O
disturbed O
by O
her O
teasing O
insistency, O
she O
would O
never O
have O
thought O
it O
worthwhile O
to O
soothe O
me O
with O
this O
frankness--even O
though, O
since O
she O
not O
infrequently O
used O
me O
to O
execute O
commissions O
that O
were O
not O
only O
troublesome, O
but O
risky, O
she O
ought, O
in O
my O
opinion, O
to O
have O
been O
frank O
in O
ANY O
case. O
But, O
forsooth, O
it O
was O
not O
worth O
her O
while O
to O
trouble O
about O
MY O
feelings--about O
the O
fact O
that O
I O
was O
uneasy, O
and, O
perhaps, O
thrice O
as O
put O
about O
by O
her O
cares O
and O
misfortunes O
as O
she O
was O
herself! O
For O
three O
weeks O
I O
had O
known O
of O
her O
intention O
to O
take O
to O
roulette. O
She O
had O
even O
warned O
me O
that O
she O
would O
like O
me O
to O
play O
on O
her O
behalf, O
since O
it O
was O
unbecoming O
for O
her O
to O
play O
in O
person; O
and, O
from O
the O
tone O
of O
her O
words O
I O
had O
gathered O
that O
there O
was O
something O
on O
her O
mind O
besides O
a O
mere O
desire O
to O
win O
money. O
As O
if O
money O
could O
matter O
to O
HER! O
No, O
she O
had O
some O
end O
in O
view, O
and O
there O
were O
circumstances O
at O
which O
I O
could O
guess, O
but O
which O
I O
did O
not O
know O
for O
certain. O
True, O
the O
slavery O
and O
abasement O
in O
which O
she O
held O
me O
might O
have O
given O
me O
(such O
things O
often O
do O
so) O
the O
power O
to O
question O
her O
with O
abrupt O
directness O
(seeing O
that, O
inasmuch O
as O
I O
figured O
in O
her O
eyes O
as O
a O
mere O
slave O
and O
nonentity, O
she O
could O
not O
very O
well O
have O
taken O
offence O
at O
any O
rude O
curiosity); O
but O
the O
fact O
was O
that, O
though O
she O
let O
me O
question O
her, O
she O
never O
returned O
me O
a O
single O
answer, O
and O
at O
times O
did O
not O
so O
much O
as O
notice O
me. O
That O
is O
how O
matters O
stood. O
Next O
day O
there O
was O
a O
good O
deal O
of O
talk O
about O
a O
telegram O
which, O
four O
days O
ago, O
had O
been O
sent O
to O
St. O
Petersburg, O
but O
to O
which O
there O
had O
come O
no O
answer. O
The O
General O
was O
visibly O
disturbed O
and O
moody, O
for O
the O
matter O
concerned O
his O
mother. O
The O
Frenchman, O
too, O
was O
excited, O
and O
after O
dinner O
the O
whole O
party O
talked O
long O
and O
seriously O
together--the O
Frenchman's O
tone O
being O
extraordinarily O
presumptuous O
and O
offhand O
to O
everybody. O
It O
almost O
reminded O
one O
of O
the O
proverb, O
"Invite O
a O
man O
to O
your O
table, O
and O
soon O
he O
will O
place O
his O
feet O
upon O
it." O
Even O
to O
Polina PERSON
he O
was O
brusque O
almost O
to O
the O
point O
of O
rudeness. O
Yet O
still O
he O
seemed O
glad O
to O
join O
us O
in O
our O
walks O
in O
the O
Casino, O
or O
in O
our O
rides O
and O
drives O
about O
the O
town. O
I O
had O
long O
been O
aware O
of O
certain O
circumstances O
which O
bound O
the O
General O
to O
him; O
I O
had O
long O
been O
aware O
that O
in O
Russia LOCATION
they O
had O
hatched O
some O
scheme O
together O
although O
I O
did O
not O
know O
whether O
the O
plot O
had O
come O
to O
anything, O
or O
whether O
it O
was O
still O
only O
in O
the O
stage O
of O
being O
talked O
of. O
Likewise O
I O
was O
aware, O
in O
part, O
of O
a O
family O
secret--namely, O
that, O
last O
year, O
the O
Frenchman O
had O
bailed O
the O
General O
out O
of O
debt, O
and O
given O
him O
30,000 O
roubles O
wherewith O
to O
pay O
his O
Treasury ORGANIZATION
dues O
on O
retiring O
from O
the O
service. O
And O
now, O
of O
course, O
the O
General O
was O
in O
a O
vice--although O
the O
chief O
part O
in O
the O
affair O
was O
being O
played O
by O
Mlle. O
Blanche. O
Yes, O
of O
this O
last O
I O
had O
no O
doubt. O
But O
WHO O
was O
this O
Mlle. O
Blanche? O
It O
was O
said O
of O
her O
that O
she O
was O
a O
Frenchwoman O
of O
good O
birth O
who, O
living O
with O
her O
mother, O
possessed O
a O
colossal O
fortune. O
It O
was O
also O
said O
that O
she O
was O
some O
relation O
to O
the O
Marquis, O
but O
only O
a O
distant O
one O
a O
cousin, O
or O
cousin-german, O
or O
something O
of O
the O
sort. O
Likewise O
I O
knew O
that, O
up O
to O
the O
time O
of O
my O
journey O
to O
Paris, O
she O
and O
the O
Frenchman O
had O
been O
more O
ceremonious O
towards O
our O
party--they O
had O
stood O
on O
a O
much O
more O
precise O
and O
delicate O
footing O
with O
them; O
but O
that O
now O
their O
acquaintanceship--their O
friendship, O
their O
intimacy--had O
taken O
on O
a O
much O
more O
off-hand O
and O
rough-and-ready O
air. O
Perhaps O
they O
thought O
that O
our O
means O
were O
too O
modest O
for O
them, O
and, O
therefore, O
unworthy O
of O
politeness O
or O
reticence. O
Also, O
for O
the O
last O
three O
days O
I O
had O
noticed O
certain O
looks O
which O
Astley PERSON
had O
kept O
throwing O
at O
Mlle. O
Blanche O
and O
her O
mother; O
and O
it O
had O
occurred O
to O
me O
that O
he O
must O
have O
had O
some O
previous O
acquaintance O
with O
the O
pair. O
I O
had O
even O
surmised O
that O
the O
Frenchman O
too O
must O
have O
met O
Mr. O
Astley PERSON
before. O
Astley PERSON
was O
a O
man O
so O
shy, O
reserved, O
and O
taciturn O
in O
his O
manner O
that O
one O
might O
have O
looked O
for O
anything O
from O
him. O
At O
all O
events O
the O
Frenchman O
accorded O
him O
only O
the O
slightest O
of O
greetings, O
and O
scarcely O
even O
looked O
at O
him. O
Certainly O
he O
did O
not O
seem O
to O
be O
afraid O
of O
him; O
which O
was O
intelligible O
enough. O
But O
why O
did O
Mlle. O
Blanche PERSON
also O
never O
look O
at O
the O
Englishman?--particularly O
since, O
a O
propos O
of O
something O
or O
another, O
the O
Marquis PERSON
had O
declared O
the O
Englishman O
to O
be O
immensely O
and O
indubitably O
rich? O
Was O
not O
that O
a O
sufficient O
reason O
to O
make O
Mlle. O
Blanche O
look O
at O
the O
Englishman? O
Anyway O
the O
General O
seemed O
extremely O
uneasy; O
and, O
one O
could O
well O
understand O
what O
a O
telegram O
to O
announce O
the O
death O
of O
his O
mother O
would O
mean O
for O
him! O
Although O
I O
thought O
it O
probable O
that O
Polina PERSON
was O
avoiding O
me O
for O
a O
definite O
reason, O
I O
adopted O
a O
cold O
and O
indifferent O
air; O
for O
I O
felt O
pretty O
certain O
that O
it O
would O
not O
be O
long O
before O
she O
herself O
approached O
me. O
For O
two O
days, O
therefore, O
I O
devoted O
my O
attention O
to O
Mlle. O
Blanche. O
The O
poor O
General O
was O
in O
despair! O
To O
fall O
in O
love O
at O
fifty-five, O
and O
with O
such O
vehemence, O
is O
indeed O
a O
misfortune! O
And O
add O
to O
that O
his O
widowerhood, O
his O
children, O
his O
ruined O
property, O
his O
debts, O
and O
the O
woman O
with O
whom O
he O
had O
fallen O
in O
love! O
Though O
Mlle. O
Blanche PERSON
was O
extremely O
good-looking, O
I O
may O
or O
may O
not O
be O
understood O
when O
I O
say O
that O
she O
had O
one O
of O
those O
faces O
which O
one O
is O
afraid O
of. O
At O
all O
events, O
I O
myself O
have O
always O
feared O
such O
women. O
Apparently O
about O
twenty-five O
years O
of O
age, O
she O
was O
tall O
and O
broad-shouldered, O
with O
shoulders O
that O
sloped; O
yet O
though O
her O
neck O
and O
bosom O
were O
ample O
in O
their O
proportions, O
her O
skin O
was O
dull O
yellow O
in O
colour, O
while O
her O
hair O
(which O
was O
extremely O
abundant--sufficient O
to O
make O
two O
coiffures) O
was O
as O
black O
as O
Indian O
ink. O
Add O
to O
that O
a O
pair O
of O
black O
eyes O
with O
yellowish O
whites, O
a O
proud O
glance, O
gleaming O
teeth, O
and O
lips O
which O
were O
perennially O
pomaded O
and O
redolent O
of O
musk. O
As O
for O
her O
dress, O
it O
was O
invariably O
rich, O
effective, O
and O
chic, O
yet O
in O
good O
taste. O
Lastly, O
her O
feet O
and O
hands O
were O
astonishing, O
and O
her O
voice O
a O
deep O
contralto. O
Sometimes, O
when O
she O
laughed, O
she O
displayed O
her O
teeth, O
but O
at O
ordinary O
times O
her O
air O
was O
taciturn O
and O
haughty--especially O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
Polina LOCATION
and O
Maria PERSON
Philipovna. O
Yet O
she O
seemed O
to O
me O
almost O
destitute O
of O
education, O
and O
even O
of O
wits, O
though O
cunning O
and O
suspicious. O
This, O
apparently, O
was O
not O
because O
her O
life O
had O
been O
lacking O
in O
incident. O
Perhaps, O
if O
all O
were O
known, O
the O
Marquis PERSON
was O
not O
her O
kinsman O
at O
all, O
nor O
her O
mother, O
her O
mother; O
but O
there O
was O
evidence O
that, O
in O
Berlin, O
where O
we O
had O
first O
come O
across O
the O
pair, O
they O
had O
possessed O
acquaintances O
of O
good O
standing. O
As O
for O
the O
Marquis O
himself, O
I O
doubt O
to O
this O
day O
if O
he O
was O
a O
Marquis--although O
about O
the O
fact O
that O
he O
had O
formerly O
belonged O
to O
high O
society O
(for O
instance, O
in O
Moscow LOCATION
and O
Germany) O
there O
could O
be O
no O
doubt O
whatever. O
What O
he O
had O
formerly O
been O
in O
France LOCATION
I O
had O
not O
a O
notion. O
All O
I O
knew O
was O
that O
he O
was O
said O
to O
possess O
a O
chateau. O
During O
the O
last O
two O
weeks O
I O
had O
looked O
for O
much O
to O
transpire, O
but O
am O
still O
ignorant O
whether O
at O
that O
time O
anything O
decisive O
ever O
passed O
between O
Mademoiselle PERSON
and O
the O
General. O
Everything O
seemed O
to O
depend O
upon O
our O
means--upon O
whether O
the O
General O
would O
be O
able O
to O
flourish O
sufficient O
money O
in O
her O
face. O
If O
ever O
the O
news O
should O
arrive O
that O
the O
grandmother O
was O
not O
dead, O
Mlle. O
Blanche, O
I O
felt O
sure, O
would O
disappear O
in O
a O
twinkling. O
Indeed, O
it O
surprised O
and O
amused O
me O
to O
observe O
what O
a O
passion O
for O
intrigue O
I O
was O
developing. O
But O
how O
I O
loathed O
it O
all! O
With O
what O
pleasure O
would O
I O
have O
given O
everybody O
and O
everything O
the O
go-by! O
Only--I O
could O
not O
leave O
Polina. O
How, O
then, O
could O
I O
show O
contempt O
for O
those O
who O
surrounded O
her? O
Espionage O
is O
a O
base O
thing, O
but--what O
have O
I O
to O
do O
with O
that? O
Mr. O
Astley, O
too, O
I O
found O
a O
curious O
person. O
I O
was O
only O
sure O
that O
he O
had O
fallen O
in O
love O
with O
Polina. O
A O
remarkable O
and O
diverting O
circumstance O
is O
the O
amount O
which O
may O
lie O
in O
the O
mien O
of O
a O
shy O
and O
painfully O
modest O
man O
who O
has O
been O
touched O
with O
the O
divine O
passion--especially O
when O
he O
would O
rather O
sink O
into O
the O
earth O
than O
betray O
himself O
by O
a O
single O
word O
or O
look. O
Though O
Mr. O
Astley PERSON
frequently O
met O
us O
when O
we O
were O
out O
walking, O
he O
would O
merely O
take O
off O
his O
hat O
and O
pass O
us O
by, O
though O
I O
knew O
he O
was O
dying O
to O
join O
us. O
Even O
when O
invited O
to O
do O
so, O
he O
would O
refuse. O
Again, O
in O
places O
of O
amusement--in O
the O
Casino, O
at O
concerts, O
or O
near O
the O
fountain--he O
was O
never O
far O
from O
the O
spot O
where O
we O
were O
sitting. O
In O
fact, O
WHEREVER O
we O
were O
in O
the O
Park, O
in O
the O
forest, O
or O
on O
the O
Shlangenberg--one O
needed O
but O
to O
raise O
one's O
eyes O
and O
glance O
around O
to O
catch O
sight O
of O
at O
least O
a O
PORTION O
of O
Mr. O
Astley's O
frame O
sticking O
out--whether O
on O
an O
adjacent O
path O
or O
behind O
a O
bush. O
Yet O
never O
did O
he O
lose O
any O
chance O
of O
speaking O
to O
myself; O
and, O
one O
morning O
when O
we O
had O
met, O
and O
exchanged O
a O
couple O
of O
words, O
he O
burst O
out O
in O
his O
usual O
abrupt O
way, O
without O
saying O
"Good-morning." O
"That O
Mlle. O
Blanche," O
he O
said. O
"Well, O
I O
have O
seen O
a O
good O
many O
women O
like O
her." O
After O
that O
he O
was O
silent O
as O
he O
looked O
me O
meaningly O
in O
the O
face. O
What O
he O
meant O
I O
did O
not O
know, O
but O
to O
my O
glance O
of O
inquiry O
he O
returned O
only O
a O
dry O
nod, O
and O
a O
reiterated O
"It O
is O
so." O
Presently, O
however, O
he O
resumed: O
"Does O
Mlle. O
Polina PERSON
like O
flowers?" O
"I O
really O
cannot O
say," O
was O
my O
reply. O
"What? O
You O
cannot O
say?" O
he O
cried O
in O
great O
astonishment. O
"No; O
I O
have O
never O
noticed O
whether O
she O
does O
so O
or O
not," O
I O
repeated O
with O
a O
smile. O
"Hm! O
Then O
I O
have O
an O
idea O
in O
my O
mind," O
he O
concluded. O
Lastly, O
with O
a O
nod, O
he O
walked O
away O
with O
a O
pleased O
expression O
on O
his O
face. O
The O
conversation O
had O
been O
carried O
on O
in O
execrable O
French. O
IV O
Today O
has O
been O
a O
day O
of O
folly, O
stupidity, O
and O
ineptness. O
The O
time O
is O
now O
eleven O
o'clock O
in O
the O
evening, O
and O
I O
am O
sitting O
in O
my O
room O
and O
thinking. O
It O
all O
began, O
this O
morning, O
with O
my O
being O
forced O
to O
go O
and O
play O
roulette O
for O
Polina PERSON
Alexandrovna. O
When O
she O
handed O
me O
over O
her O
store O
of O
six O
hundred O
gulden O
I O
exacted O
two O
conditions--namely, O
that O
I O
should O
not O
go O
halves O
with O
her O
in O
her O
winnings, O
if O
any O
(that O
is O
to O
say, O
I O
should O
not O
take O
anything O
for O
myself), O
and O
that O
she O
should O
explain O
to O
me, O
that O
same O
evening, O
why O
it O
was O
so O
necessary O
for O
her O
to O
win, O
and O
how O
much O
was O
the O
sum O
which O
she O
needed. O
For, O
I O
could O
not O
suppose O
that O
she O
was O
doing O
all O
this O
merely O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
money. O
Yet O
clearly O
she O
did O
need O
some O
money, O
and O
that O
as O
soon O
as O
possible, O
and O
for O
a O
special O
purpose. O
Well, O
she O
promised O
to O
explain O
matters, O
and O
I O
departed. O
There O
was O
a O
tremendous O
crowd O
in O
the O
gaming-rooms. O
What O
an O
arrogant, O
greedy O
crowd O
it O
was! O
I O
pressed O
forward O
towards O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
room O
until O
I O
had O
secured O
a O
seat O
at O
a O
croupier's O
elbow. O
Then O
I O
began O
to O
play O
in O
timid O
fashion, O
venturing O
only O
twenty O
or O
thirty O
gulden O
at O
a O
time. O
Meanwhile, O
I O
observed O
and O
took O
notes. O
It O
seemed O
to O
me O
that O
calculation O
was O
superfluous, O
and O
by O
no O
means O
possessed O
of O
the O
importance O
which O
certain O
other O
players O
attached O
to O
it, O
even O
though O
they O
sat O
with O
ruled O
papers O
in O
their O
hands, O
whereon O
they O
set O
down O
the O
coups, O
calculated O
the O
chances, O
reckoned, O
staked, O
and--lost O
exactly O
as O
we O
more O
simple O
mortals O
did O
who O
played O
without O
any O
reckoning O
at O
all. O
However, O
I O
deduced O
from O
the O
scene O
one O
conclusion O
which O
seemed O
to O
me O
reliable--namely, O
that O
in O
the O
flow O
of O
fortuitous O
chances O
there O
is, O
if O
not O
a O
system, O
at O
all O
events O
a O
sort O
of O
order. O
This, O
of O
course, O
is O
a O
very O
strange O
thing. O
For O
instance, O
after O
a O
dozen O
middle O
figures O
there O
would O
always O
occur O
a O
dozen O
or O
so O
outer O
ones. O
Suppose O
the O
ball O
stopped O
twice O
at O
a O
dozen O
outer O
figures; O
it O
would O
then O
pass O
to O
a O
dozen O
of O
the O
first O
ones, O
and O
then, O
again, O
to O
a O
dozen O
of O
the O
middle O
ciphers, O
and O
fall O
upon O
them O
three O
or O
four O
times, O
and O
then O
revert O
to O
a O
dozen O
outers; O
whence, O
after O
another O
couple O
of O
rounds, O
the O
ball O
would O
again O
pass O
to O
the O
first O
figures, O
strike O
upon O
them O
once, O
and O
then O
return O
thrice O
to O
the O
middle O
series--continuing O
thus O
for O
an O
hour O
and O
a O
half, O
or O
two O
hours. O
One, O
three, O
two: O
one, O
three, O
two. O
It O
was O
all O
very O
curious. O
Again, O
for O
the O
whole O
of O
a O
day O
or O
a O
morning O
the O
red O
would O
alternate O
with O
the O
black, O
but O
almost O
without O
any O
order, O
and O
from O
moment O
to O
moment, O
so O
that O
scarcely O
two O
consecutive O
rounds O
would O
end O
upon O
either O
the O
one O
or O
the O
other. O
Yet, O
next O
day, O
or, O
perhaps, O
the O
next O
evening, O
the O
red O
alone O
would O
turn O
up, O
and O
attain O
a O
run O
of O
over O
two O
score, O
and O
continue O
so O
for O
quite O
a O
length O
of O
time--say, O
for O
a O
whole O
day. O
Of O
these O
circumstances O
the O
majority O
were O
pointed O
out O
to O
me O
by O
Mr. O
Astley, O
who O
stood O
by O
the O
gaming-table O
the O
whole O
morning, O
yet O
never O
once O
staked O
in O
person. O
For O
myself, O
I O
lost O
all O
that O
I O
had O
on O
me, O
and O
with O
great O
speed. O
To O
begin O
with, O
I O
staked O
two O
hundred O
gulden O
on O
"even," O
and O
won. O
Then O
I O
staked O
the O
same O
amount O
again, O
and O
won: O
and O
so O
on O
some O
two O
or O
three O
times. O
At O
one O
moment O
I O
must O
have O
had O
in O
my O
hands--gathered O
there O
within O
a O
space O
of O
five O
minutes--about O
4000 O
gulden. O
That, O
of O
course, O
was O
the O
proper O
moment O
for O
me O
to O
have O
departed, O
but O
there O
arose O
in O
me O
a O
strange O
sensation O
as O
of O
a O
challenge O
to O
Fate--as O
of O
a O
wish O
to O
deal O
her O
a O
blow O
on O
the O
cheek, O
and O
to O
put O
out O
my O
tongue O
at O
her. O
Accordingly O
I O
set O
down O
the O
largest O
stake O
allowed O
by O
the O
rules--namely, O
4000 O
gulden--and O
lost. O
Fired O
by O
this O
mishap, O
I O
pulled O
out O
all O
the O
money O
left O
to O
me, O
staked O
it O
all O
on O
the O
same O
venture, O
and--again O
lost! O
Then O
I O
rose O
from O
the O
table, O
feeling O
as O
though O
I O
were O
stupefied. O
What O
had O
happened O
to O
me O
I O
did O
not O
know; O
but, O
before O
luncheon O
I O
told O
Polina PERSON
of O
my O
losses--until O
which O
time O
I O
walked O
about O
the O
Park. O
At O
luncheon O
I O
was O
as O
excited O
as O
I O
had O
been O
at O
the O
meal O
three O
days O
ago. O
Mlle. O
Blanche O
and O
the O
Frenchman O
were O
lunching O
with O
us, O
and O
it O
appeared O
that O
the O
former O
had O
been O
to O
the O
Casino O
that O
morning, O
and O
had O
seen O
my O
exploits O
there. O
So O
now O
she O
showed O
me O
more O
attention O
when O
talking O
to O
me; O
while, O
for O
his O
part, O
the O
Frenchman O
approached O
me, O
and O
asked O
outright O
if O
it O
had O
been O
my O
own O
money O
that O
I O
had O
lost. O
He O
appeared O
to O
be O
suspicious O
as O
to O
something O
being O
on O
foot O
between O
Polina PERSON
and O
myself, O
but O
I O
merely O
fired O
up, O
and O
replied O
that O
the O
money O
had O
been O
all O
my O
own. O
At O
this O
the O
General O
seemed O
extremely O
surprised, O
and O
asked O
me O
whence O
I O
had O
procured O
it; O
whereupon O
I O
replied O
that, O
though O
I O
had O
begun O
only O
with O
100 O
gulden, O
six O
or O
seven O
rounds O
had O
increased O
my O
capital O
to O
5000 O
or O
6000 O
gulden, O
and O
that O
subsequently O
I O
had O
lost O
the O
whole O
in O
two O
rounds. O
All O
this, O
of O
course, O
was O
plausible O
enough. O
During O
my O
recital O
I O
glanced O
at O
Polina, O
but O
nothing O
was O
to O
be O
discerned O
on O
her O
face. O
However, O
she O
had O
allowed O
me O
to O
fire O
up O
without O
correcting O
me, O
and O
from O
that O
I O
concluded O
that O
it O
was O
my O
cue O
to O
fire O
up, O
and O
to O
conceal O
the O
fact O
that O
I O
had O
been O
playing O
on O
her O
behalf. O
"At O
all O
events," O
I O
thought O
to O
myself, O
"she, O
in O
her O
turn, O
has O
promised O
to O
give O
me O
an O
explanation O
to-night, O
and O
to O
reveal O
to O
me O
something O
or O
another." O
Although O
the O
General O
appeared O
to O
be O
taking O
stock O
of O
me, O
he O
said O
nothing. O
Yet O
I O
could O
see O
uneasiness O
and O
annoyance O
in O
his O
face. O
Perhaps O
his O
straitened O
circumstances O
made O
it O
hard O
for O
him O
to O
have O
to O
hear O
of O
piles O
of O
gold O
passing O
through O
the O
hands O
of O
an O
irresponsible O
fool O
like O
myself O
within O
the O
space O
of O
a O
quarter O
of O
an O
hour. O
Now, O
I O
have O
an O
idea O
that, O
last O
night, O
he O
and O
the O
Frenchman O
had O
a O
sharp O
encounter O
with O
one O
another. O
At O
all O
events O
they O
closeted O
themselves O
together, O
and O
then O
had O
a O
long O
and O
vehement O
discussion; O
after O
which O
the O
Frenchman O
departed O
in O
what O
appeared O
to O
be O
a O
passion, O
but O
returned, O
early O
this O
morning, O
to O
renew O
the O
combat. O
On O
hearing O
of O
my O
losses, O
however, O
he O
only O
remarked O
with O
a O
sharp, O
and O
even O
a O
malicious, O
air O
that O
"a O
man O
ought O
to O
go O
more O
carefully." O
Next, O
for O
some O
reason O
or O
another, O
he O
added O
that, O
"though O
a O
great O
many O
Russians O
go O
in O
for O
gambling, O
they O
are O
no O
good O
at O
the O
game." O
"I O
think O
that O
roulette O
was O
devised O
specially O
for O
Russians," O
I O
retorted; O
and O
when O
the O
Frenchman O
smiled O
contemptuously O
at O
my O
reply O
I O
further O
remarked O
that O
I O
was O
sure O
I O
was O
right; O
also O
that, O
speaking O
of O
Russians O
in O
the O
capacity O
of O
gamblers, O
I O
had O
far O
more O
blame O
for O
them O
than O
praise--of O
that O
he O
could O
be O
quite O
sure. O
"Upon O
what O
do O
you O
base O
your O
opinion?" O
he O
inquired. O
"Upon O
the O
fact O
that O
to O
the O
virtues O
and O
merits O
of O
the O
civilised O
Westerner O
there O
has O
become O
historically O
added--though O
this O
is O
not O
his O
chief O
point--a O
capacity O
for O
acquiring O
capital; O
whereas, O
not O
only O
is O
the O
Russian O
incapable O
of O
acquiring O
capital, O
but O
also O
he O
exhausts O
it O
wantonly O
and O
of O
sheer O
folly. O
None O
the O
less O
we O
Russians O
often O
need O
money; O
wherefore, O
we O
are O
glad O
of, O
and O
greatly O
devoted O
to, O
a O
method O
of O
acquisition O
like O
roulette--whereby, O
in O
a O
couple O
of O
hours, O
one O
may O
grow O
rich O
without O
doing O
any O
work. O
This O
method, O
I O
repeat, O
has O
a O
great O
attraction O
for O
us, O
but O
since O
we O
play O
in O
wanton O
fashion, O
and O
without O
taking O
any O
trouble, O
we O
almost O
invariably O
lose." O
"To O
a O
certain O
extent O
that O
is O
true," O
assented O
the O
Frenchman O
with O
a O
self-satisfied O
air. O
"Oh O
no, O
it O
is O
not O
true," O
put O
in O
the O
General O
sternly. O
"And O
you," O
he O
added O
to O
me, O
"you O
ought O
to O
be O
ashamed O
of O
yourself O
for O
traducing O
your O
own O
country!" O
"I O
beg O
pardon," O
I O
said. O
"Yet O
it O
would O
be O
difficult O
to O
say O
which O
is O
the O
worst O
of O
the O
two--Russian O
ineptitude O
or O
the O
German O
method O
of O
growing O
rich O
through O
honest O
toil." O
"What O
an O
extraordinary O
idea," O
cried O
the O
General. O
"And O
what O
a O
RUSSIAN O
idea!" O
added O
the O
Frenchman. O
I O
smiled, O
for O
I O
was O
rather O
glad O
to O
have O
a O
quarrel O
with O
them. O
"I O
would O
rather O
live O
a O
wandering O
life O
in O
tents," O
I O
cried, O
"than O
bow O
the O
knee O
to O
a O
German O
idol!" O
"To O
WHAT O
idol?" O
exclaimed O
the O
General, O
now O
seriously O
angry. O
"To O
the O
German O
method O
of O
heaping O
up O
riches. O
I O
have O
not O
been O
here O
very O
long, O
but O
I O
can O
tell O
you O
that O
what O
I O
have O
seen O
and O
verified O
makes O
my O
Tartar O
blood O
boil. O
Good O
Lord! O
I O
wish O
for O
no O
virtues O
of O
that O
kind. O
Yesterday O
I O
went O
for O
a O
walk O
of O
about O
ten O
versts; O
and, O
everywhere O
I O
found O
that O
things O
were O
even O
as O
we O
read O
of O
them O
in O
good O
German O
picture-books--that O
every O
house O
has O
its O
'Fater,' O
who O
is O
horribly O
beneficent O
and O
extraordinarily O
honourable. O
So O
honourable O
is O
he O
that O
it O
is O
dreadful O
to O
have O
anything O
to O
do O
with O
him; O
and O
I O
cannot O
bear O
people O
of O
that O
sort. O
Each O
such O
'Fater' O
has O
his O
family, O
and O
in O
the O
evenings O
they O
read O
improving O
books O
aloud. O
Over O
their O
roof-trees O
there O
murmur O
elms O
and O
chestnuts; O
the O
sun O
has O
sunk O
to O
his O
rest; O
a O
stork O
is O
roosting O
on O
the O
gable; O
and O
all O
is O
beautifully O
poetic O
and O
touching. O
Do O
not O
be O
angry, O
General. O
Let O
me O
tell O
you O
something O
that O
is O
even O
more O
touching O
than O
that. O
I O
can O
remember O
how, O
of O
an O
evening, O
my O
own O
father, O
now O
dead, O
used O
to O
sit O
under O
the O
lime O
trees O
in O
his O
little O
garden, O
and O
to O
read O
books O
aloud O
to O
myself O
and O
my O
mother. O
Yes, O
I O
know O
how O
things O
ought O
to O
be O
done. O
Yet O
every O
German O
family O
is O
bound O
to O
slavery O
and O
to O
submission O
to O
its O
'Fater.' O
They O
work O
like O
oxen, O
and O
amass O
wealth O
like O
Jews. O
Suppose O
the O
'Fater' O
has O
put O
by O
a O
certain O
number O
of O
gulden O
which O
he O
hands O
over O
to O
his O
eldest O
son, O
in O
order O
that O
the O
said O
son O
may O
acquire O
a O
trade O
or O
a O
small O
plot O
of O
land. O
Well, O
one O
result O
is O
to O
deprive O
the O
daughter O
of O
a O
dowry, O
and O
so O
leave O
her O
among O
the O
unwedded. O
For O
the O
same O
reason, O
the O
parents O
will O
have O
to O
sell O
the O
younger O
son O
into O
bondage O
or O
the O
ranks O
of O
the O
army, O
in O
order O
that O
he O
may O
earn O
more O
towards O
the O
family O
capital. O
Yes, O
such O
things O
ARE O
done, O
for O
I O
have O
been O
making O
inquiries O
on O
the O
subject. O
It O
is O
all O
done O
out O
of O
sheer O
rectitude--out O
of O
a O
rectitude O
which O
is O
magnified O
to O
the O
point O
of O
the O
younger O
son O
believing O
that O
he O
has O
been O
RIGHTLY O
sold, O
and O
that O
it O
is O
simply O
idyllic O
for O
the O
victim O
to O
rejoice O
when O
he O
is O
made O
over O
into O
pledge. O
What O
more O
have O
I O
to O
tell? O
Well, O
this--that O
matters O
bear O
just O
as O
hardly O
upon O
the O
eldest O
son. O
Perhaps O
he O
has O
his O
Gretchen PERSON
to O
whom O
his O
heart O
is O
bound; O
but O
he O
cannot O
marry O
her, O
for O
the O
reason O
that O
he O
has O
not O
yet O
amassed O
sufficient O
gulden. O
So, O
the O
pair O
wait O
on O
in O
a O
mood O
of O
sincere O
and O
virtuous O
expectation, O
and O
smilingly O
deposit O
themselves O
in O
pawn O
the O
while. O
Gretchen's O
cheeks O
grow O
sunken, O
and O
she O
begins O
to O
wither; O
until O
at O
last, O
after O
some O
twenty O
years, O
their O
substance O
has O
multiplied, O
and O
sufficient O
gulden O
have O
been O
honourably O
and O
virtuously O
accumulated. O
Then O
the O
'Fater' O
blesses O
his O
forty-year-old O
heir O
and O
the O
thirty-five-year-old O
Gretchen PERSON
with O
the O
sunken O
bosom O
and O
the O
scarlet O
nose; O
after O
which O
he O
bursts, O
into O
tears, O
reads O
the O
pair O
a O
lesson O
on O
morality, O
and O
dies. O
In O
turn O
the O
eldest O
son O
becomes O
a O
virtuous O
'Fater,' O
and O
the O
old O
story O
begins O
again. O
In O
fifty O
or O
sixty O
years' O
time O
the O
grandson O
of O
the O
original O
'Fater' O
will O
have O
amassed O
a O
considerable O
sum; O
and O
that O
sum O
he O
will O
hand O
over O
to, O
his O
son, O
and O
the O
latter O
to O
HIS O
son, O
and O
so O
on O
for O
several O
generations; O
until O
at O
length O
there O
will O
issue O
a O
Baron O
Rothschild, O
or O
a O
'Hoppe O
and O
Company,' O
or O
the O
devil O
knows O
what! O
Is O
it O
not O
a O
beautiful O
spectacle--the O
spectacle O
of O
a O
century O
or O
two O
of O
inherited O
labour, O
patience, O
intellect, O
rectitude, O
character, O
perseverance, O
and O
calculation, O
with O
a O
stork O
sitting O
on O
the O
roof O
above O
it O
all? O
What O
is O
more; O
they O
think O
there O
can O
never O
be O
anything O
better O
than O
this; O
wherefore, O
from O
their O
point O
of O
view O
they O
begin O
to O
judge O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
world, O
and O
to O
censure O
all O
who O
are O
at O
fault--that O
is O
to O
say, O
who O
are O
not O
exactly O
like O
themselves. O
Yes, O
there O
you O
have O
it O
in O
a O
nutshell. O
For O
my O
own O
part, O
I O
would O
rather O
grow O
fat O
after O
the O
Russian O
manner, O
or O
squander O
my O
whole O
substance O
at O
roulette. O
I O
have O
no O
wish O
to O
be O
'Hoppe O
and O
Company' O
at O
the O
end O
of O
five O
generations. O
I O
want O
the O
money O
for O
MYSELF, O
for O
in O
no O
way O
do O
I O
look O
upon O
my O
personality O
as O
necessary O
to, O
or O
meet O
to O
be O
given O
over O
to, O
capital. O
I O
may O
be O
wrong, O
but O
there O
you O
have O
it. O
Those O
are O
MY O
views." O
"How O
far O
you O
may O
be O
right O
in O
what O
you O
have O
said O
I O
do O
not O
know," O
remarked O
the O
General O
moodily; O
"but O
I O
DO O
know O
that O
you O
are O
becoming O
an O
insufferable O
farceur O
whenever O
you O
are O
given O
the O
least O
chance." O
As O
usual, O
he O
left O
his O
sentence O
unfinished. O
Indeed, O
whenever O
he O
embarked O
upon O
anything O
that O
in O
the O
least O
exceeded O
the O
limits O
of O
daily O
small-talk, O
he O
left O
unfinished O
what O
he O
was O
saying. O
The O
Frenchman O
had O
listened O
to O
me O
contemptuously, O
with O
a O
slight O
protruding O
of O
his O
eyes; O
but, O
he O
could O
not O
have O
understood O
very O
much O
of O
my O
harangue. O
As O
for O
Polina, O
she O
had O
looked O
on O
with O
serene O
indifference. O
She O
seemed O
to O
have O
heard O
neither O
my O
voice O
nor O
any O
other O
during O
the O
progress O
of O
the O
meal. O
V O
Yes, O
she O
had O
been O
extraordinarily O
meditative. O
Yet, O
on O
leaving O
the O
table, O
she O
immediately O
ordered O
me O
to O
accompany O
her O
for O
a O
walk. O
We O
took O
the O
children O
with O
us, O
and O
set O
out O
for O
the O
fountain O
in O
the O
Park. O
I O
was O
in O
such O
an O
irritated O
frame O
of O
mind O
that O
in O
rude O
and O
abrupt O
fashion O
I O
blurted O
out O
a O
question O
as O
to O
"why O
our O
Marquis PERSON
de PERSON
Griers PERSON
had O
ceased O
to O
accompany O
her O
for O
strolls, O
or O
to O
speak O
to O
her O
for O
days O
together." O
"Because O
he O
is O
a O
brute," O
she O
replied O
in O
rather O
a O
curious O
way. O
It O
was O
the O
first O
time O
that O
I O
had O
heard O
her O
speak O
so O
of O
De O
Griers: O
consequently, O
I O
was O
momentarily O
awed O
into O
silence O
by O
this O
expression O
of O
resentment. O
"Have O
you O
noticed, O
too, O
that O
today O
he O
is O
by O
no O
means O
on O
good O
terms O
with O
the O
General?" O
I O
went O
on. O
"Yes--and O
I O
suppose O
you O
want O
to O
know O
why," O
she O
replied O
with O
dry O
captiousness. O
"You O
are O
aware, O
are O
you O
not, O
that O
the O
General O
is O
mortgaged O
to O
the O
Marquis, O
with O
all O
his O
property? O
Consequently, O
if O
the O
General's O
mother O
does O
not O
die, O
the O
Frenchman O
will O
become O
the O
absolute O
possessor O
of O
everything O
which O
he O
now O
holds O
only O
in O
pledge." O
"Then O
it O
is O
really O
the O
case O
that O
everything O
is O
mortgaged? O
I O
have O
heard O
rumours O
to O
that O
effect, O
but O
was O
unaware O
how O
far O
they O
might O
be O
true." O
"Yes, O
they O
ARE O
true. O
What O
then?" O
"Why, O
it O
will O
be O
a O
case O
of O
'Farewell, O
Mlle. O
Blanche,'" O
I O
remarked; O
"for O
in O
such O
an O
event O
she O
would O
never O
become O
Madame O
General. O
Do O
you O
know, O
I O
believe O
the O
old O
man O
is O
so O
much O
in O
love O
with O
her O
that O
he O
will O
shoot O
himself O
if O
she O
should O
throw O
him O
over. O
At O
his O
age O
it O
is O
a O
dangerous O
thing O
to O
fall O
in O
love." O
"Yes, O
something, O
I O
believe, O
WILL O
happen O
to O
him," O
assented O
Polina PERSON
thoughtfully. O
"And O
what O
a O
fine O
thing O
it O
all O
is!" O
I O
continued. O
"Could O
anything O
be O
more O
abominable O
than O
the O
way O
in O
which O
she O
has O
agreed O
to O
marry O
for O
money O
alone? O
Not O
one O
of O
the O
decencies O
has O
been O
observed; O
the O
whole O
affair O
has O
taken O
place O
without O
the O
least O
ceremony. O
And O
as O
for O
the O
grandmother, O
what O
could O
be O
more O
comical, O
yet O
more O
dastardly, O
than O
the O
sending O
of O
telegram O
after O
telegram O
to O
know O
if O
she O
is O
dead? O
What O
do O
you O
think O
of O
it, O
Polina O
Alexandrovna?" O
"Yes, O
it O
is O
very O
horrible," O
she O
interrupted O
with O
a O
shudder. O
"Consequently, O
I O
am O
the O
more O
surprised O
that O
YOU O
should O
be O
so O
cheerful. O
What O
are O
YOU O
so O
pleased O
about? O
About O
the O
fact O
that O
you O
have O
gone O
and O
lost O
my O
money?" O
"What? O
The O
money O
that O
you O
gave O
me O
to O
lose? O
I O
told O
you O
I O
should O
never O
win O
for O
other O
people--least O
of O
all O
for O
you. O
I O
obeyed O
you O
simply O
because O
you O
ordered O
me O
to; O
but O
you O
must O
not O
blame O
me O
for O
the O
result. O
I O
warned O
you O
that O
no O
good O
would O
ever O
come O
of O
it. O
You O
seem O
much O
depressed O
at O
having O
lost O
your O
money. O
Why O
do O
you O
need O
it O
so O
greatly?" O
"Why O
do O
YOU O
ask O
me O
these O
questions?" O
"Because O
you O
promised O
to O
explain O
matters O
to O
me. O
Listen. O
I O
am O
certain O
that, O
as O
soon O
as O
ever O
I O
'begin O
to O
play O
for O
myself' O
(and O
I O
still O
have O
120 O
gulden O
left), O
I O
shall O
win. O
You O
can O
then O
take O
of O
me O
what O
you O
require." O
She O
made O
a O
contemptuous O
grimace. O
"You O
must O
not O
be O
angry O
with O
me," O
I O
continued, O
"for O
making O
such O
a O
proposal. O
I O
am O
so O
conscious O
of O
being O
only O
a O
nonentity O
in O
your O
eyes O
that O
you O
need O
not O
mind O
accepting O
money O
from O
me. O
A O
gift O
from O
me O
could O
not O
possibly O
offend O
you. O
Moreover, O
it O
was O
I O
who O
lost O
your O
gulden." O
She O
glanced O
at O
me, O
but, O
seeing O
that O
I O
was O
in O
an O
irritable, O
sarcastic O
mood, O
changed O
the O
subject. O
"My O
affairs O
cannot O
possibly O
interest O
you," O
she O
said. O
"Still, O
if O
you O
DO O
wish O
to O
know, O
I O
am O
in O
debt. O
I O
borrowed O
some O
money, O
and O
must O
pay O
it O
back O
again. O
I O
have O
a O
curious, O
senseless O
idea O
that O
I O
am O
bound O
to O
win O
at O
the O
gaming-tables. O
Why O
I O
think O
so O
I O
cannot O
tell, O
but O
I O
do O
think O
so, O
and O
with O
some O
assurance. O
Perhaps O
it O
is O
because O
of O
that O
assurance O
that O
I O
now O
find O
myself O
without O
any O
other O
resource." O
"Or O
perhaps O
it O
is O
because O
it O
is O
so O
NECESSARY O
for O
you O
to O
win. O
It O
is O
like O
a O
drowning O
man O
catching O
at O
a O
straw. O
You O
yourself O
will O
agree O
that, O
unless O
he O
were O
drowning O
he O
would O
not O
mistake O
a O
straw O
for O
the O
trunk O
of O
a O
tree." O
Polina PERSON
looked O
surprised. O
"What?" O
she O
said. O
"Do O
not O
you O
also O
hope O
something O
from O
it? O
Did O
you O
not O
tell O
me O
again O
and O
again, O
two O
weeks O
ago, O
that O
you O
were O
certain O
of O
winning O
at O
roulette O
if O
you O
played O
here? O
And O
did O
you O
not O
ask O
me O
not O
to O
consider O
you O
a O
fool O
for O
doing O
so? O
Were O
you O
joking? O
You O
cannot O
have O
been, O
for O
I O
remember O
that O
you O
spoke O
with O
a O
gravity O
which O
forbade O
the O
idea O
of O
your O
jesting." O
"True," O
I O
replied O
gloomily. O
"I O
always O
felt O
certain O
that O
I O
should O
win. O
Indeed, O
what O
you O
say O
makes O
me O
ask O
myself--Why O
have O
my O
absurd, O
senseless O
losses O
of O
today O
raised O
a O
doubt O
in O
my O
mind? O
Yet O
I O
am O
still O
positive O
that, O
so O
soon O
as O
ever O
I O
begin O
to O
play O
for O
myself, O
I O
shall O
infallibly O
win." O
"And O
why O
are O
you O
so O
certain?" O
"To O
tell O
the O
truth, O
I O
do O
not O
know. O
I O
only O
know O
that O
I O
must O
win--that O
it O
is O
the O
one O
resource O
I O
have O
left. O
Yes, O
why O
do O
I O
feel O
so O
assured O
on O
the O
point?" O
"Perhaps O
because O
one O
cannot O
help O
winning O
if O
one O
is O
fanatically O
certain O
of O
doing O
so." O
"Yet O
I O
dare O
wager O
that O
you O
do O
not O
think O
me O
capable O
of O
serious O
feeling O
in O
the O
matter?" O
"I O
do O
not O
care O
whether O
you O
are O
so O
or O
not," O
answered O
Polina PERSON
with O
calm O
indifference. O
"Well, O
since O
you O
ask O
me, O
I O
DO O
doubt O
your O
ability O
to O
take O
anything O
seriously. O
You O
are O
capable O
of O
worrying, O
but O
not O
deeply. O
You O
are O
too O
ill-regulated O
and O
unsettled O
a O
person O
for O
that. O
But O
why O
do O
you O
want O
money? O
Not O
a O
single O
one O
of O
the O
reasons O
which O
you O
have O
given O
can O
be O
looked O
upon O
as O
serious." O
"By O
the O
way," O
I O
interrupted, O
"you O
say O
you O
want O
to O
pay O
off O
a O
debt. O
It O
must O
be O
a O
large O
one. O
Is O
it O
to O
the O
Frenchman?" O
"What O
do O
you O
mean O
by O
asking O
all O
these O
questions? O
You O
are O
very O
clever O
today. O
Surely O
you O
are O
not O
drunk?" O
"You O
know O
that O
you O
and O
I O
stand O
on O
no O
ceremony, O
and O
that O
sometimes O
I O
put O
to O
you O
very O
plain O
questions. O
I O
repeat O
that O
I O
am O
your O
slave--and O
slaves O
cannot O
be O
shamed O
or O
offended." O
"You O
talk O
like O
a O
child. O
It O
is O
always O
possible O
to O
comport O
oneself O
with O
dignity. O
If O
one O
has O
a O
quarrel O
it O
ought O
to O
elevate O
rather O
than O
to O
degrade O
one." O
"A O
maxim O
straight O
from O
the O
copybook! O
Suppose O
I O
CANNOT O
comport O
myself O
with O
dignity. O
By O
that O
I O
mean O
that, O
though O
I O
am O
a O
man O
of O
self-respect, O
I O
am O
unable O
to O
carry O
off O
a O
situation O
properly. O
Do O
you O
know O
the O
reason? O
It O
is O
because O
we O
Russians O
are O
too O
richly O
and O
multifariously O
gifted O
to O
be O
able O
at O
once O
to O
find O
the O
proper O
mode O
of O
expression. O
It O
is O
all O
a O
question O
of O
mode. O
Most O
of O
us O
are O
so O
bounteously O
endowed O
with O
intellect O
as O
to O
require O
also O
a O
spice O
of O
genius O
to O
choose O
the O
right O
form O
of O
behaviour. O
And O
genius O
is O
lacking O
in O
us O
for O
the O
reason O
that O
so O
little O
genius O
at O
all O
exists. O
It O
belongs O
only O
to O
the O
French--though O
a O
few O
other O
Europeans O
have O
elaborated O
their O
forms O
so O
well O
as O
to O
be O
able O
to O
figure O
with O
extreme O
dignity, O
and O
yet O
be O
wholly O
undignified O
persons. O
That O
is O
why, O
with O
us, O
the O
mode O
is O
so O
all-important. O
The O
Frenchman O
may O
receive O
an O
insult--a O
real, O
a O
venomous O
insult: O
yet, O
he O
will O
not O
so O
much O
as O
frown. O
But O
a O
tweaking O
of O
the O
nose O
he O
cannot O
bear, O
for O
the O
reason O
that O
such O
an O
act O
is O
an O
infringement O
of O
the O
accepted, O
of O
the O
time-hallowed O
order O
of O
decorum. O
That O
is O
why O
our O
good O
ladies O
are O
so O
fond O
of O
Frenchmen--the O
Frenchman's O
manners, O
they O
say, O
are O
perfect! O
But O
in O
my O
opinion O
there O
is O
no O
such O
thing O
as O
a O
Frenchman's O
manners. O
The O
Frenchman O
is O
only O
a O
bird--the O
coq O
gaulois. O
At O
the O
same O
time, O
as O
I O
am O
not O
a O
woman, O
I O
do O
not O
properly O
understand O
the O
question. O
Cocks O
may O
be O
excellent O
birds. O
If O
I O
am O
wrong O
you O
must O
stop O
me. O
You O
ought O
to O
stop O
and O
correct O
me O
more O
often O
when O
I O
am O
speaking O
to O
you, O
for O
I O
am O
too O
apt O
to O
say O
everything O
that O
is O
in O
my O
head. O
"You O
see, O
I O
have O
lost O
my O
manners. O
I O
agree O
that O
I O
have O
none, O
nor O
yet O
any O
dignity. O
I O
will O
tell O
you O
why. O
I O
set O
no O
store O
upon O
such O
things. O
Everything O
in O
me O
has O
undergone O
a O
cheek. O
You O
know O
the O
reason. O
I O
have O
not O
a O
single O
human O
thought O
in O
my O
head. O
For O
a O
long O
while O
I O
have O
been O
ignorant O
of O
what O
is O
going O
on O
in O
the O
world--here O
or O
in O
Russia. O
I O
have O
been O
to O
Dresden, O
yet O
am O
completely O
in O
the O
dark O
as O
to O
what O
Dresden LOCATION
is O
like. O
You O
know O
the O
cause O
of O
my O
obsession. O
I O
have O
no O
hope O
now, O
and O
am O
a O
mere O
cipher O
in O
your O
eyes; O
wherefore, O
I O
tell O
you O
outright O
that O
wherever O
I O
go O
I O
see O
only O
you--all O
the O
rest O
is O
a O
matter O
of O
indifference. O
"Why O
or O
how O
I O
have O
come O
to O
love O
you O
I O
do O
not O
know. O
It O
may O
be O
that O
you O
are O
not O
altogether O
fair O
to O
look O
upon. O
Do O
you O
know, O
I O
am O
ignorant O
even O
as O
to O
what O
your O
face O
is O
like. O
In O
all O
probability, O
too, O
your O
heart O
is O
not O
comely, O
and O
it O
is O
possible O
that O
your O
mind O
is O
wholly O
ignoble." O
"And O
because O
you O
do O
not O
believe O
in O
my O
nobility O
of O
soul O
you O
think O
to O
purchase O
me O
with O
money?" O
she O
said. O
"WHEN O
have O
I O
thought O
to O
do O
so?" O
was O
my O
reply. O
"You O
are O
losing O
the O
thread O
of O
the O
argument. O
If O
you O
do O
not O
wish O
to O
purchase O
me, O
at O
all O
events O
you O
wish O
to O
purchase O
my O
respect." O
"Not O
at O
all. O
I O
have O
told O
you O
that O
I O
find O
it O
difficult O
to O
explain O
myself. O
You O
are O
hard O
upon O
me. O
Do O
not O
be O
angry O
at O
my O
chattering. O
You O
know O
why O
you O
ought O
not O
to O
be O
angry O
with O
me--that O
I O
am O
simply O
an O
imbecile. O
However, O
I O
do O
not O
mind O
if O
you O
ARE O
angry. O
Sitting O
in O
my O
room, O
I O
need O
but O
to O
think O
of O
you, O
to O
imagine O
to O
myself O
the O
rustle O
of O
your O
dress, O
and O
at O
once O
I O
fall O
almost O
to O
biting O
my O
hands. O
Why O
should O
you O
be O
angry O
with O
me? O
Because O
I O
call O
myself O
your O
slave? O
Revel, O
I O
pray O
you, O
in O
my O
slavery--revel O
in O
it. O
Do O
you O
know O
that O
sometimes O
I O
could O
kill O
you?--not O
because O
I O
do O
not O
love O
you, O
or O
am O
jealous O
of O
you, O
but, O
because O
I O
feel O
as O
though O
I O
could O
simply O
devour O
you... O
You O
are O
laughing!" O
"No, O
I O
am O
not," O
she O
retorted. O
"But O
I O
order O
you, O
nevertheless, O
to O
be O
silent." O
She O
stopped, O
well O
nigh O
breathless O
with O
anger. O
God O
knows, O
she O
may O
not O
have O
been O
a O
beautiful O
woman, O
yet O
I O
loved O
to O
see O
her O
come O
to O
a O
halt O
like O
this, O
and O
was O
therefore, O
the O
more O
fond O
of O
arousing O
her O
temper. O
Perhaps O
she O
divined O
this, O
and O
for O
that O
very O
reason O
gave O
way O
to O
rage. O
I O
said O
as O
much O
to O
her. O
"What O
rubbish!" O
she O
cried O
with O
a O
shudder. O
"I O
do O
not O
care," O
I O
continued. O
"Also, O
do O
you O
know O
that O
it O
is O
not O
safe O
for O
us O
to O
take O
walks O
together? O
Often O
I O
have O
a O
feeling O
that O
I O
should O
like O
to O
strike O
you, O
to O
disfigure O
you, O
to O
strangle O
you. O
Are O
you O
certain O
that O
it O
will O
never O
come O
to O
that? O
You O
are O
driving O
me O
to O
frenzy. O
Am O
I O
afraid O
of O
a O
scandal, O
or O
of O
your O
anger? O
Why O
should O
I O
fear O
your O
anger? O
I O
love O
without O
hope, O
and O
know O
that O
hereafter O
I O
shall O
love O
you O
a O
thousand O
times O
more. O
If O
ever O
I O
should O
kill O
you O
I O
should O
have O
to O
kill O
myself O
too. O
But O
I O
shall O
put O
off O
doing O
so O
as O
long O
as O
possible, O
for O
I O
wish O
to O
continue O
enjoying O
the O
unbearable O
pain O
which O
your O
coldness O
gives O
me. O
Do O
you O
know O
a O
very O
strange O
thing? O
It O
is O
that, O
with O
every O
day, O
my O
love O
for O
you O
increases--though O
that O
would O
seem O
to O
be O
almost O
an O
impossibility. O
Why O
should O
I O
not O
become O
a O
fatalist? O
Remember O
how, O
on O
the O
third O
day O
that O
we O
ascended O
the O
Shlangenberg, O
I O
was O
moved O
to O
whisper O
in O
your O
ear: O
'Say O
but O
the O
word, O
and O
I O
will O
leap O
into O
the O
abyss.' O
Had O
you O
said O
it, O
I O
should O
have O
leapt. O
Do O
you O
not O
believe O
me?" O
"What O
stupid O
rubbish!" O
she O
cried. O
"I O
care O
not O
whether O
it O
be O
wise O
or O
stupid," O
I O
cried O
in O
return. O
"I O
only O
know O
that O
in O
your O
presence O
I O
must O
speak, O
speak, O
speak. O
Therefore, O
I O
am O
speaking. O
I O
lose O
all O
conceit O
when O
I O
am O
with O
you, O
and O
everything O
ceases O
to O
matter." O
"Why O
should O
I O
have O
wanted O
you O
to O
leap O
from O
the O
Shlangenberg?" O
she O
said O
drily, O
and O
(I O
think) O
with O
wilful O
offensiveness. O
"THAT O
would O
have O
been O
of O
no O
use O
to O
me." O
"Splendid!" O
I O
shouted. O
"I O
know O
well O
that O
you O
must O
have O
used O
the O
words O
'of O
no O
use' O
in O
order O
to O
crush O
me. O
I O
can O
see O
through O
you. O
'Of O
no O
use,' O
did O
you O
say? O
Why, O
to O
give O
pleasure O
is O
ALWAYS O
of O
use; O
and, O
as O
for O
barbarous, O
unlimited O
power--even O
if O
it O
be O
only O
over O
a O
fly--why, O
it O
is O
a O
kind O
of O
luxury. O
Man O
is O
a O
despot O
by O
nature, O
and O
loves O
to O
torture. O
You, O
in O
particular, O
love O
to O
do O
so." O
I O
remember O
that O
at O
this O
moment O
she O
looked O
at O
me O
in O
a O
peculiar O
way. O
The O
fact O
is O
that O
my O
face O
must O
have O
been O
expressing O
all O
the O
maze O
of O
senseless, O
gross O
sensations O
which O
were O
seething O
within O
me. O
To O
this O
day O
I O
can O
remember, O
word O
for O
word, O
the O
conversation O
as O
I O
have O
written O
it O
down. O
My O
eyes O
were O
suffused O
with O
blood, O
and O
the O
foam O
had O
caked O
itself O
on O
my O
lips. O
Also, O
on O
my O
honour O
I O
swear O
that, O
had O
she O
bidden O
me O
cast O
myself O
from O
the O
summit O
of O
the O
Shlangenberg, O
I O
should O
have O
done O
it. O
Yes, O
had O
she O
bidden O
me O
in O
jest, O
or O
only O
in O
contempt O
and O
with O
a O
spit O
in O
my O
face, O
I O
should O
have O
cast O
myself O
down. O
"Oh O
no! O
Why O
so? O
I O
believe O
you," O
she O
said, O
but O
in O
such O
a O
manner--in O
the O
manner O
of O
which, O
at O
times, O
she O
was O
a O
mistress--and O
with O
such O
a O
note O
of O
disdain O
and O
viperish O
arrogance O
in O
her O
tone, O
that O
God O
knows O
I O
could O
have O
killed O
her. O
Yes, O
at O
that O
moment O
she O
stood O
in O
peril. O
I O
had O
not O
lied O
to O
her O
about O
that. O
"Surely O
you O
are O
not O
a O
coward?" O
suddenly O
she O
asked O
me. O
"I O
do O
not O
know," O
I O
replied. O
"Perhaps O
I O
am, O
but O
I O
do O
not O
know. O
I O
have O
long O
given O
up O
thinking O
about O
such O
things." O
"If O
I O
said O
to O
you, O
'Kill O
that O
man,' O
would O
you O
kill O
him?" O
"Whom?" O
"Whomsoever O
I O
wish?" O
"The O
Frenchman?" O
"Do O
not O
ask O
me O
questions; O
return O
me O
answers. O
I O
repeat, O
whomsoever O
I O
wish? O
I O
desire O
to O
see O
if O
you O
were O
speaking O
seriously O
just O
now." O
She O
awaited O
my O
reply O
with O
such O
gravity O
and O
impatience O
that O
I O
found O
the O
situation O
unpleasant. O
"Do O
YOU, O
rather, O
tell O
me," O
I O
said, O
"what O
is O
going O
on O
here? O
Why O
do O
you O
seem O
half-afraid O
of O
me? O
I O
can O
see O
for O
myself O
what O
is O
wrong. O
You O
are O
the O
step-daughter O
of O
a O
ruined O
and O
insensate O
man O
who O
is O
smitten O
with O
love O
for O
this O
devil O
of O
a O
Blanche. O
And O
there O
is O
this O
Frenchman, O
too, O
with O
his O
mysterious O
influence O
over O
you. O
Yet, O
you O
actually O
ask O
me O
such O
a O
question! O
If O
you O
do O
not O
tell O
me O
how O
things O
stand, O
I O
shall O
have O
to O
put O
in O
my O
oar O
and O
do O
something. O
Are O
you O
ashamed O
to O
be O
frank O
with O
me? O
Are O
you O
shy O
of O
me?" O
"I O
am O
not O
going O
to O
talk O
to O
you O
on O
that O
subject. O
I O
have O
asked O
you O
a O
question, O
and O
am O
waiting O
for O
an O
answer." O
"Well, O
then--I O
will O
kill O
whomsoever O
you O
wish," O
I O
said. O
"But O
are O
you O
REALLY O
going O
to O
bid O
me O
do O
such O
deeds?" O
"Why O
should O
you O
think O
that O
I O
am O
going O
to O
let O
you O
off? O
I O
shall O
bid O
you O
do O
it, O
or O
else O
renounce O
me. O
Could O
you O
ever O
do O
the O
latter? O
No, O
you O
know O
that O
you O
couldn't. O
You O
would O
first O
kill O
whom O
I O
had O
bidden O
you, O
and O
then O
kill O
ME O
for O
having O
dared O
to O
send O
you O
away!" O
Something O
seemed O
to O
strike O
upon O
my O
brain O
as O
I O
heard O
these O
words. O
Of O
course, O
at O
the O
time O
I O
took O
them O
half O
in O
jest O
and O
half O
as O
a O
challenge; O
yet, O
she O
had O
spoken O
them O
with O
great O
seriousness. O
I O
felt O
thunderstruck O
that O
she O
should O
so O
express O
herself, O
that O
she O
should O
assert O
such O
a O
right O
over O
me, O
that O
she O
should O
assume O
such O
authority O
and O
say O
outright: O
"Either O
you O
kill O
whom O
I O
bid O
you, O
or O
I O
will O
have O
nothing O
more O
to O
do O
with O
you." O
Indeed, O
in O
what O
she O
had O
said O
there O
was O
something O
so O
cynical O
and O
unveiled O
as O
to O
pass O
all O
bounds. O
For O
how O
could O
she O
ever O
regard O
me O
as O
the O
same O
after O
the O
killing O
was O
done? O
This O
was O
more O
than O
slavery O
and O
abasement; O
it O
was O
sufficient O
to O
bring O
a O
man O
back O
to O
his O
right O
senses. O
Yet, O
despite O
the O
outrageous O
improbability O
of O
our O
conversation, O
my O
heart O
shook O
within O
me. O
Suddenly, O
she O
burst O
out O
laughing. O
We O
were O
seated O
on O
a O
bench O
near O
the O
spot O
where O
the O
children O
were O
playing--just O
opposite O
the O
point O
in O
the O
alley-way O
before O
the O
Casino O
where O
the O
carriages O
drew O
up O
in O
order O
to O
set O
down O
their O
occupants. O
"Do O
you O
see O
that O
fat O
Baroness?" O
she O
cried. O
"It O
is O
the O
Baroness O
Burmergelm. O
She O
arrived O
three O
days O
ago. O
Just O
look O
at O
her O
husband--that O
tall, O
wizened O
Prussian O
there, O
with O
the O
stick O
in O
his O
hand. O
Do O
you O
remember O
how O
he O
stared O
at O
us O
the O
other O
day? O
Well, O
go O
to O
the O
Baroness, O
take O
off O
your O
hat O
to O
her, O
and O
say O
something O
in O
French." O
"Why?" O
"Because O
you O
have O
sworn O
that O
you O
would O
leap O
from O
the O
Shlangenberg O
for O
my O
sake, O
and O
that O
you O
would O
kill O
any O
one O
whom O
I O
might O
bid O
you O
kill. O
Well, O
instead O
of O
such O
murders O
and O
tragedies, O
I O
wish O
only O
for O
a O
good O
laugh. O
Go O
without O
answering O
me, O
and O
let O
me O
see O
the O
Baron O
give O
you O
a O
sound O
thrashing O
with O
his O
stick." O
"Then O
you O
throw O
me O
out O
a O
challenge?--you O
think O
that O
I O
will O
not O
do O
it?" O
"Yes, O
I O
do O
challenge O
you. O
Go, O
for O
such O
is O
my O
will." O
"Then O
I O
WILL O
go, O
however O
mad O
be O
your O
fancy. O
Only, O
look O
here: O
shall O
you O
not O
be O
doing O
the O
General O
a O
great O
disservice, O
as O
well O
as, O
through O
him, O
a O
great O
disservice O
to O
yourself? O
It O
is O
not O
about O
myself O
I O
am O
worrying--it O
is O
about O
you O
and O
the O
General. O
Why, O
for O
a O
mere O
fancy, O
should O
I O
go O
and O
insult O
a O
woman?" O
"Ah! O
Then O
I O
can O
see O
that O
you O
are O
only O
a O
trifler," O
she O
said O
contemptuously. O
"Your O
eyes O
are O
swimming O
with O
blood--but O
only O
because O
you O
have O
drunk O
a O
little O
too O
much O
at O
luncheon. O
Do O
I O
not O
know O
that O
what O
I O
have O
asked O
you O
to O
do O
is O
foolish O
and O
wrong, O
and O
that O
the O
General O
will O
be O
angry O
about O
it? O
But O
I O
want O
to O
have O
a O
good O
laugh, O
all O
the O
same. O
I O
want O
that, O
and O
nothing O
else. O
Why O
should O
you O
insult O
a O
woman, O
indeed? O
Well, O
you O
will O
be O
given O
a O
sound O
thrashing O
for O
so O
doing." O
I O
turned O
away, O
and O
went O
silently O
to O
do O
her O
bidding. O
Of O
course O
the O
thing O
was O
folly, O
but O
I O
could O
not O
get O
out O
of O
it. O
I O
remember O
that, O
as O
I O
approached O
the O
Baroness, O
I O
felt O
as O
excited O
as O
a O
schoolboy. O
I O
was O
in O
a O
frenzy, O
as O
though O
I O
were O
drunk. O
VI O
Two O
days O
have O
passed O
since O
that O
day O
of O
lunacy. O
What O
a O
noise O
and O
a O
fuss O
and O
a O
chattering O
and O
an O
uproar O
there O
was! O
And O
what O
a O
welter O
of O
unseemliness O
and O
disorder O
and O
stupidity O
and O
bad O
manners! O
And O
I O
the O
cause O
of O
it O
all! O
Yet O
part O
of O
the O
scene O
was O
also O
ridiculous--at O
all O
events O
to O
myself O
it O
was O
so. O
I O
am O
not O
quite O
sure O
what O
was O
the O
matter O
with O
me--whether O
I O
was O
merely O
stupefied O
or O
whether O
I O
purposely O
broke O
loose O
and O
ran O
amok. O
At O
times O
my O
mind O
seems O
all O
confused; O
while O
at O
other O
times O
I O
seem O
almost O
to O
be O
back O
in O
my O
childhood, O
at O
the O
school O
desk, O
and O
to O
have O
done O
the O
deed O
simply O
out O
of O
mischief. O
It O
all O
came O
of O
Polina--yes, O
of O
Polina. O
But O
for O
her, O
there O
might O
never O
have O
been O
a O
fracas. O
Or O
perhaps O
I O
did O
the O
deed O
in O
a O
fit O
of O
despair O
(though O
it O
may O
be O
foolish O
of O
me O
to O
think O
so)? O
What O
there O
is O
so O
attractive O
about O
her O
I O
cannot O
think. O
Yet O
there O
IS O
something O
attractive O
about O
her--something O
passing O
fair, O
it O
would O
seem. O
Others O
besides O
myself O
she O
has O
driven O
to O
distraction. O
She O
is O
tall O
and O
straight, O
and O
very O
slim. O
Her O
body O
looks O
as O
though O
it O
could O
be O
tied O
into O
a O
knot, O
or O
bent O
double, O
like O
a O
cord. O
The O
imprint O
of O
her O
foot O
is O
long O
and O
narrow. O
It O
is, O
a O
maddening O
imprint--yes, O
simply O
a O
maddening O
one! O
And O
her O
hair O
has O
a O
reddish O
tint O
about O
it, O
and O
her O
eyes O
are O
like O
cat's O
eyes--though O
able O
also O
to O
glance O
with O
proud, O
disdainful O
mien. O
On O
the O
evening O
of O
my O
first O
arrival, O
four O
months O
ago, O
I O
remember O
that O
she O
was O
sitting O
and O
holding O
an O
animated O
conversation O
with O
De PERSON
Griers PERSON
in O
the O
salon. O
And O
the O
way O
in O
which O
she O
looked O
at O
him O
was O
such O
that O
later, O
when O
I O
retired O
to O
my O
own O
room O
upstairs, O
I O
kept O
fancying O
that O
she O
had O
smitten O
him O
in O
the O
face--that O
she O
had O
smitten O
him O
right O
on O
the O
cheek, O
so O
peculiar O
had O
been O
her O
look O
as O
she O
stood O
confronting O
him. O
Ever O
since O
that O
evening O
I O
have O
loved O
her. O
But O
to O
my O
tale. O
I O
stepped O
from O
the O
path O
into O
the O
carriage-way, O
and O
took O
my O
stand O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
it. O
There O
I O
awaited O
the O
Baron O
and O
the O
Baroness. O
When O
they O
were O
but O
a O
few O
paces O
distant O
from O
me O
I O
took O
off O
my O
hat, O
and O
bowed. O
I O
remember O
that O
the O
Baroness PERSON
was O
clad O
in O
a O
voluminous O
silk O
dress, O
pale O
grey O
in O
colour, O
and O
adorned O
with O
flounces O
and O
a O
crinoline O
and O
train. O
Also, O
she O
was O
short O
and O
inordinately O
stout, O
while O
her O
gross, O
flabby O
chin O
completely O
concealed O
her O
neck. O
Her O
face O
was O
purple, O
and O
the O
little O
eyes O
in O
it O
had O
an O
impudent, O
malicious O
expression. O
Yet O
she O
walked O
as O
though O
she O
were O
conferring O
a O
favour O
upon O
everybody O
by O
so O
doing. O
As O
for O
the O
Baron, O
he O
was O
tall, O
wizened, O
bony-faced O
after O
the O
German O
fashion, O
spectacled, O
and, O
apparently, O
about O
forty-five O
years O
of O
age. O
Also, O
he O
had O
legs O
which O
seemed O
to O
begin O
almost O
at O
his O
chest--or, O
rather, O
at O
his O
chin! O
Yet, O
for O
all O
his O
air O
of O
peacock-like O
conceit, O
his O
clothes O
sagged O
a O
little, O
and O
his O
face O
wore O
a O
sheepish O
air O
which O
might O
have O
passed O
for O
profundity. O
These O
details O
I O
noted O
within O
a O
space O
of O
a O
few O
seconds. O
At O
first O
my O
bow O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
I O
had O
my O
hat O
in O
my O
hand O
barely O
caught O
their O
attention. O
The O
Baron O
only O
scowled O
a O
little, O
and O
the O
Baroness PERSON
swept O
straight O
on. O
"Madame O
la O
Baronne," O
said O
I, O
loudly O
and O
distinctly--embroidering O
each O
word, O
as O
it O
were--"j'ai O
l'honneur O
d'etre O
votre O
esclave." O
Then O
I O
bowed O
again, O
put O
on O
my O
hat, O
and O
walked O
past O
the O
Baron O
with O
a O
rude O
smile O
on O
my O
face. O
Polina PERSON
had O
ordered O
me O
merely O
to O
take O
off O
my O
hat: O
the O
bow O
and O
the O
general O
effrontery O
were O
of O
my O
own O
invention. O
God O
knows O
what O
instigated O
me O
to O
perpetrate O
the O
outrage! O
In O
my O
frenzy O
I O
felt O
as O
though O
I O
were O
walking O
on O
air. O
"Hein!" O
ejaculated--or, O
rather, O
growled--the O
Baron PERSON
as O
he O
turned O
towards O
me O
in O
angry O
surprise. O
I O
too O
turned O
round, O
and O
stood O
waiting O
in O
pseudo-courteous O
expectation. O
Yet O
still O
I O
wore O
on O
my O
face O
an O
impudent O
smile O
as O
I O
gazed O
at O
him. O
He O
seemed O
to O
hesitate, O
and O
his O
brows O
contracted O
to O
their O
utmost O
limits. O
Every O
moment O
his O
visage O
was O
growing O
darker. O
The O
Baroness PERSON
also O
turned O
in O
my O
direction, O
and O
gazed O
at O
me O
in O
wrathful O
perplexity, O
while O
some O
of O
the O
passers-by O
also O
began O
to O
stare O
at O
us, O
and O
others O
of O
them O
halted O
outright. O
"Hein!" O
the O
Baron O
vociferated O
again, O
with O
a O
redoubled O
growl O
and O
a O
note O
of O
growing O
wrath O
in O
his O
voice. O
"Ja O
wohl!" O
I O
replied, O
still O
looking O
him O
in O
the O
eyes. O
"Sind O
sie O
rasend?" O
he O
exclaimed, O
brandishing O
his O
stick, O
and, O
apparently, O
beginning O
to O
feel O
nervous. O
Perhaps O
it O
was O
my O
costume O
which O
intimidated O
him, O
for O
I O
was O
well O
and O
fashionably O
dressed, O
after O
the O
manner O
of O
a O
man O
who O
belongs O
to O
indisputably O
good O
society. O
"Ja O
wo-o-ohl!" O
cried O
I O
again O
with O
all O
my O
might O
with O
a O
longdrawn O
rolling O
of O
the O
"ohl" O
sound O
after O
the O
fashion O
of O
the O
Berliners O
(who O
constantly O
use O
the O
phrase O
"Ja O
wohl!" O
in O
conversation, O
and O
more O
or O
less O
prolong O
the O
syllable O
"ohl" O
according O
as O
they O
desire O
to O
express O
different O
shades O
of O
meaning O
or O
of O
mood). O
At O
this O
the O
Baron O
and O
the O
Baroness PERSON
faced O
sharply O
about, O
and O
almost O
fled O
in O
their O
alarm. O
Some O
of O
the O
bystanders O
gave O
vent O
to O
excited O
exclamations, O
and O
others O
remained O
staring O
at O
me O
in O
astonishment. O
But O
I O
do O
not O
remember O
the O
details O
very O
well. O
Wheeling O
quietly O
about, O
I O
returned O
in O
the O
direction O
of O
Polina LOCATION
Alexandrovna. LOCATION
But, O
when O
I O
had O
got O
within O
a O
hundred O
paces O
of O
her O
seat, O
I O
saw O
her O
rise O
and O
set O
out O
with O
the O
children O
towards O
the O
hotel. O
At O
the O
portico O
I O
caught O
up O
to O
her. O
"I O
have O
perpetrated O
the--the O
piece O
of O
idiocy," O
I O
said O
as O
I O
came O
level O
with O
her. O
"Have O
you? O
Then O
you O
can O
take O
the O
consequences," O
she O
replied O
without O
so O
much O
as O
looking O
at O
me. O
Then O
she O
moved O
towards O
the O
staircase. O
I O
spent O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
evening O
walking O
in O
the O
park. O
Thence O
I O
passed O
into O
the O
forest, O
and O
walked O
on O
until O
I O
found O
myself O
in O
a O
neighbouring O
principality. O
At O
a O
wayside O
restaurant O
I O
partook O
of O
an O
omelette O
and O
some O
wine, O
and O
was O
charged O
for O
the O
idyllic O
repast O
a O
thaler O
and O
a O
half. O
Not O
until O
eleven O
o'clock O
did O
I O
return O
home--to O
find O
a O
summons O
awaiting O
me O
from O
the O
General. O
Our O
party O
occupied O
two O
suites O
in O
the O
hotel; O
each O
of O
which O
contained O
two O
rooms. O
The O
first O
(the O
larger O
suite) O
comprised O
a O
salon O
and O
a O
smoking-room, O
with, O
adjoining O
the O
latter, O
the O
General's O
study. O
It O
was O
here O
that O
he O
was O
awaiting O
me O
as O
he O
stood O
posed O
in O
a O
majestic O
attitude O
beside O
his O
writing-table. O
Lolling O
on O
a O
divan O
close O
by O
was O
De O
Griers. O
"My O
good O
sir," O
the O
General O
began, O
"may O
I O
ask O
you O
what O
this O
is O
that O
you O
have O
gone O
and O
done?" O
"I O
should O
be O
glad," O
I O
replied, O
"if O
we O
could O
come O
straight O
to O
the O
point. O
Probably O
you O
are O
referring O
to O
my O
encounter O
of O
today O
with O
a O
German?" O
"With O
a O
German? O
Why, O
the O
German O
was O
the O
Baron O
Burmergelm--a O
most O
important O
personage! O
I O
hear O
that O
you O
have O
been O
rude O
both O
to O
him O
and O
to O
the O
Baroness?" O
"No, O
I O
have O
not." O
"But O
I O
understand O
that O
you O
simply O
terrified O
them, O
my O
good O
sir?" O
shouted O
the O
General. O
"Not O
in O
the O
least," O
I O
replied. O
"You O
must O
know O
that O
when O
I O
was O
in O
Berlin LOCATION
I O
frequently O
used O
to O
hear O
the O
Berliners O
repeat, O
and O
repellently O
prolong, O
a O
certain O
phrase--namely, O
'Ja O
wohl!'; O
and, O
happening O
to O
meet O
this O
couple O
in O
the O
carriage-drive, O
I O
found, O
for O
some O
reason O
or O
another, O
that O
this O
phrase O
suddenly O
recurred O
to O
my O
memory, O
and O
exercised O
a O
rousing O
effect O
upon O
my O
spirits. O
Moreover, O
on O
the O
three O
previous O
occasions O
that O
I O
have O
met O
the O
Baroness O
she O
has O
walked O
towards O
me O
as O
though O
I O
were O
a O
worm O
which O
could O
easily O
be O
crushed O
with O
the O
foot. O
Not O
unnaturally, O
I O
too O
possess O
a O
measure O
of O
self-respect; O
wherefore, O
on O
THIS O
occasion O
I O
took O
off O
my O
hat, O
and O
said O
politely O
(yes, O
I O
assure O
you O
it O
was O
said O
politely): O
'Madame, O
j'ai O
l'honneur O
d'etre O
votre O
esclave.' O
Then O
the O
Baron O
turned O
round, O
and O
said O
'Hein!'; O
whereupon O
I O
felt O
moved O
to O
ejaculate O
in O
answer O
'Ja O
wohl!' O
Twice O
I O
shouted O
it O
at O
him--the O
first O
time O
in O
an O
ordinary O
tone, O
and O
the O
second O
time O
with O
the O
greatest O
prolonging O
of O
the O
words O
of O
which O
I O
was O
capable. O
That O
is O
all." O
I O
must O
confess O
that O
this O
puerile O
explanation O
gave O
me O
great O
pleasure. O
I O
felt O
a O
strong O
desire O
to O
overlay O
the O
incident O
with O
an O
even O
added O
measure O
of O
grossness; O
so, O
the O
further O
I O
proceeded, O
the O
more O
did O
the O
gusto O
of O
my O
proceeding O
increase. O
"You O
are O
only O
making O
fun O
of O
me!" O
vociferated O
the O
General O
as, O
turning O
to O
the O
Frenchman, O
he O
declared O
that O
my O
bringing O
about O
of O
the O
incident O
had O
been O
gratuitous. O
De PERSON
Griers PERSON
smiled O
contemptuously, O
and O
shrugged O
his O
shoulders. O
"Do O
not O
think O
THAT," O
I O
put O
in. O
"It O
was O
not O
so O
at O
all. O
I O
grant O
you O
that O
my O
behaviour O
was O
bad--I O
fully O
confess O
that O
it O
was O
so, O
and O
make O
no O
secret O
of O
the O
fact. O
I O
would O
even O
go O
so O
far O
as O
to O
grant O
you O
that O
my O
behaviour O
might O
well O
be O
called O
stupid O
and O
indecent O
tomfoolery; O
but, O
MORE O
than O
that O
it O
was O
not. O
Also, O
let O
me O
tell O
you O
that O
I O
am O
very O
sorry O
for O
my O
conduct. O
Yet O
there O
is O
one O
circumstance O
which, O
in O
my O
eyes, O
almost O
absolves O
me O
from O
regret O
in O
the O
matter. O
Of O
late--that O
is O
to O
say, O
for O
the O
last O
two O
or O
three O
weeks--I O
have O
been O
feeling O
not O
at O
all O
well. O
That O
is O
to O
say, O
I O
have O
been O
in O
a O
sick, O
nervous, O
irritable, O
fanciful O
condition, O
so O
that O
I O
have O
periodically O
lost O
control O
over O
myself. O
For O
instance, O
on O
more O
than O
one O
occasion O
I O
have O
tried O
to O
pick O
a O
quarrel O
even O
with O
Monsieur PERSON
le PERSON
Marquise PERSON
here; O
and, O
under O
the O
circumstances, O
he O
had O
no O
choice O
but O
to O
answer O
me. O
In O
short, O
I O
have O
recently O
been O
showing O
signs O
of O
ill-health. O
Whether O
the O
Baroness PERSON
Burmergelm PERSON
will O
take O
this O
circumstance O
into O
consideration O
when O
I O
come O
to O
beg O
her O
pardon O
(for O
I O
do O
intend O
to O
make O
her O
amends) O
I O
do O
not O
know; O
but O
I O
doubt O
if O
she O
will, O
and O
the O
less O
so O
since, O
so O
far O
as O
I O
know, O
the O
circumstance O
is O
one O
which, O
of O
late, O
has O
begun O
to O
be O
abused O
in O
the O
legal O
world, O
in O
that O
advocates O
in O
criminal O
cases O
have O
taken O
to O
justifying O
their O
clients O
on O
the O
ground O
that, O
at O
the O
moment O
of O
the O
crime, O
they O
(the O
clients) O
were O
unconscious O
of O
what O
they O
were O
doing--that, O
in O
short, O
they O
were O
out O
of O
health. O
'My O
client O
committed O
the O
murder--that O
is O
true; O
but O
he O
has O
no O
recollection O
of O
having O
committed O
it.' O
And O
doctors O
actually O
support O
these O
advocates O
by O
affirming O
that O
there O
really O
is O
such O
a O
malady--that O
there O
really O
can O
arise O
temporary O
delusions O
which O
make O
a O
man O
remember O
nothing O
of O
a O
given O
deed, O
or O
only O
a O
half O
or O
a O
quarter O
of O
it! O
But O
the O
Baron O
and O
Baroness PERSON
are O
members O
of O
an O
older O
generation, O
as O
well O
as O
Prussian O
Junkers O
and O
landowners. O
To O
them O
such O
a O
process O
in O
the O
medico-judicial O
world O
will O
be O
unknown, O
and O
therefore, O
they O
are O
the O
more O
unlikely O
to O
accept O
any O
such O
explanation. O
What O
is O
YOUR O
opinion O
about O
it, O
General?" O
"Enough, O
sir!" O
he O
thundered O
with O
barely O
restrained O
fury. O
"Enough, O
I O
say! O
Once O
and O
for O
all O
I O
must O
endeavour O
to O
rid O
myself O
of O
you O
and O
your O
impertinence. O
To O
justify O
yourself O
in O
the O
eyes O
of O
the O
Baron O
and O
Baroness PERSON
will O
be O
impossible. O
Any O
intercourse O
with O
you, O
even O
though O
it O
be O
confined O
to O
a O
begging O
of O
their O
pardons, O
they O
would O
look O
upon O
as O
a O
degradation. O
I O
may O
tell O
you O
that, O
on O
learning O
that O
you O
formed O
part O
of, O
my O
household, O
the O
Baron O
approached O
me O
in O
the O
Casino, O
and O
demanded O
of O
me O
additional O
satisfaction. O
Do O
you O
understand, O
then, O
what O
it O
is O
that O
you O
have O
entailed O
upon O
me--upon O
ME, O
my O
good O
sir? O
You O
have O
entailed O
upon O
me O
the O
fact O
of O
my O
being O
forced O
to O
sue O
humbly O
to O
the O
Baron, O
and O
to O
give O
him O
my O
word O
of O
honour O
that O
this O
very O
day O
you O
shall O
cease O
to O
belong O
to O
my O
establishment!" O
"Excuse O
me, O
General," O
I O
interrupted, O
"but O
did O
he O
make O
an O
express O
point O
of O
it O
that O
I O
should O
'cease O
to O
belong O
to O
your O
establishment,' O
as O
you O
call O
it?" O
"No; O
I, O
of O
my O
own O
initiative, O
thought O
that O
I O
ought O
to O
afford O
him O
that O
satisfaction; O
and, O
with O
it O
he O
was O
satisfied. O
So O
we O
must O
part, O
good O
sir. O
It O
is O
my O
duty O
to O
hand O
over O
to O
you O
forty O
gulden, O
three O
florins, O
as O
per O
the O
accompanying O
statement. O
Here O
is O
the O
money, O
and O
here O
the O
account, O
which O
you O
are O
at O
liberty O
to O
verify. O
Farewell. O
From O
henceforth O
we O
are O
strangers. O
From O
you O
I O
have O
never O
had O
anything O
but O
trouble O
and O
unpleasantness. O
I O
am O
about O
to O
call O
the O
landlord, O
and O
explain O
to O
him O
that O
from O
tomorrow O
onwards O
I O
shall O
no O
longer O
be O
responsible O
for O
your O
hotel O
expenses. O
Also O
I O
have O
the O
honour O
to O
remain O
your O
obedient O
servant." O
I O
took O
the O
money O
and O
the O
account O
(which O
was O
indicted O
in O
pencil), O
and, O
bowing O
low O
to O
the O
General, O
said O
to O
him O
very O
gravely: O
"The O
matter O
cannot O
end O
here. O
I O
regret O
very O
much O
that O
you O
should O
have O
been O
put O
to O
unpleasantness O
at O
the O
Baron's O
hands; O
but, O
the O
fault O
(pardon O
me) O
is O
your O
own. O
How O
came O
you O
to O
answer O
for O
me O
to O
the O
Baron? O
And O
what O
did O
you O
mean O
by O
saying O
that O
I O
formed O
part O
of O
your O
household? O
I O
am O
merely O
your O
family O
tutor--not O
a O
son O
of O
yours, O
nor O
yet O
your O
ward, O
nor O
a O
person O
of O
any O
kind O
for O
whose O
acts O
you O
need O
be O
responsible. O
I O
am O
a O
judicially O
competent O
person, O
a O
man O
of O
twenty-five O
years O
of O
age, O
a O
university O
graduate, O
a O
gentleman, O
and, O
until O
I O
met O
yourself, O
a O
complete O
stranger O
to O
you. O
Only O
my O
boundless O
respect O
for O
your O
merits O
restrains O
me O
from O
demanding O
satisfaction O
at O
your O
hands, O
as O
well O
as O
a O
further O
explanation O
as O
to O
the O
reasons O
which O
have O
led O
you O
to O
take O
it O
upon O
yourself O
to O
answer O
for O
my O
conduct." O
So O
struck O
was O
he O
with O
my O
words O
that, O
spreading O
out O
his O
hands, O
he O
turned O
to O
the O
Frenchman, O
and O
interpreted O
to O
him O
that O
I O
had O
challenged O
himself O
(the O
General) O
to O
a O
duel. O
The O
Frenchman O
laughed O
aloud. O
"Nor O
do O
I O
intend O
to O
let O
the O
Baron O
off," O
I O
continued O
calmly, O
but O
with O
not O
a O
little O
discomfiture O
at O
De O
Griers' O
merriment. O
"And O
since O
you, O
General, O
have O
today O
been O
so O
good O
as O
to O
listen O
to O
the O
Baron's O
complaints, O
and O
to O
enter O
into O
his O
concerns--since O
you O
have O
made O
yourself O
a O
participator O
in O
the O
affair--I O
have O
the O
honour O
to O
inform O
you O
that, O
tomorrow O
morning O
at O
the O
latest, O
I O
shall, O
in O
my O
own O
name, O
demand O
of O
the O
said O
Baron PERSON
a O
formal O
explanation O
as O
to O
the O
reasons O
which O
have O
led O
him O
to O
disregard O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
matter O
lies O
between O
him O
and O
myself O
alone, O
and O
to O
put O
a O
slight O
upon O
me O
by O
referring O
it O
to O
another O
person, O
as O
though O
I O
were O
unworthy O
to O
answer O
for O
my O
own O
conduct." O
Then O
there O
happened O
what O
I O
had O
foreseen. O
The O
General O
on O
hearing O
of O
this O
further O
intended O
outrage, O
showed O
the O
white O
feather. O
"What?" O
he O
cried. O
"Do O
you O
intend O
to O
go O
on O
with O
this O
damned O
nonsense? O
Do O
you O
not O
realise O
the O
harm O
that O
it O
is O
doing O
me? O
I O
beg O
of O
you O
not O
to O
laugh O
at O
me, O
sir--not O
to O
laugh O
at O
me, O
for O
we O
have O
police O
authorities O
here O
who, O
out O
of O
respect O
for O
my O
rank, O
and O
for O
that O
of O
the O
Baron... O
In O
short, O
sir, O
I O
swear O
to O
you O
that O
I O
will O
have O
you O
arrested, O
and O
marched O
out O
of O
the O
place, O
to O
prevent O
any O
further O
brawling O
on O
your O
part. O
Do O
you O
understand O
what O
I O
say?" O
He O
was O
almost O
breathless O
with O
anger, O
as O
well O
as O
in O
a O
terrible O
fright. O
"General," O
I O
replied O
with O
that O
calmness O
which O
he O
never O
could O
abide, O
"one O
cannot O
arrest O
a O
man O
for O
brawling O
until O
he O
has O
brawled. O
I O
have O
not O
so O
much O
as O
begun O
my O
explanations O
to O
the O
Baron, O
and O
you O
are O
altogether O
ignorant O
as O
to O
the O
form O
and O
time O
which O
my O
intended O
procedure O
is O
likely O
to O
assume. O
I O
wish O
but O
to O
disabuse O
the O
Baron O
of O
what O
is, O
to O
me, O
a O
shameful O
supposition--namely, O
that O
I O
am O
under O
the O
guardianship O
of O
a O
person O
who O
is O
qualified O
to O
exercise O
control O
over O
my O
free O
will. O
It O
is O
vain O
for O
you O
to O
disturb O
and O
alarm O
yourself." O
"For O
God's O
sake, O
Alexis PERSON
Ivanovitch, PERSON
do O
put O
an O
end O
to O
this O
senseless O
scheme O
of O
yours!" O
he O
muttered, O
but O
with O
a O
sudden O
change O
from O
a O
truculent O
tone O
to O
one O
of O
entreaty O
as O
he O
caught O
me O
by O
the O
hand. O
"Do O
you O
know O
what O
is O
likely O
to O
come O
of O
it? O
Merely O
further O
unpleasantness. O
You O
will O
agree O
with O
me, O
I O
am O
sure, O
that O
at O
present O
I O
ought O
to O
move O
with O
especial O
care--yes, O
with O
very O
especial O
care. O
You O
cannot O
be O
fully O
aware O
of O
how O
I O
am O
situated. O
When O
we O
leave O
this O
place O
I O
shall O
be O
ready O
to O
receive O
you O
back O
into O
my O
household; O
but, O
for O
the O
time O
being O
I-- O
Well, O
I O
cannot O
tell O
you O
all O
my O
reasons." O
With O
that O
he O
wound O
up O
in O
a O
despairing O
voice: O
"O O
Alexis PERSON
Ivanovitch, O
Alexis PERSON
Ivanovitch!" O
I O
moved O
towards O
the O
door--begging O
him O
to O
be O
calm, O
and O
promising O
that O
everything O
should O
be O
done O
decently O
and O
in O
order; O
whereafter O
I O
departed. O
Russians, O
when O
abroad, O
are O
over-apt O
to O
play O
the O
poltroon, O
to O
watch O
all O
their O
words, O
and O
to O
wonder O
what O
people O
are O
thinking O
of O
their O
conduct, O
or O
whether O
such O
and O
such O
a O
thing O
is O
'comme O
il O
faut.' O
In O
short, O
they O
are O
over-apt O
to O
cosset O
themselves, O
and O
to O
lay O
claim O
to O
great O
importance. O
Always O
they O
prefer O
the O
form O
of O
behaviour O
which O
has O
once O
and O
for O
all O
become O
accepted O
and O
established. O
This O
they O
will O
follow O
slavishly O
whether O
in O
hotels, O
on O
promenades, O
at O
meetings, O
or O
when O
on O
a O
journey. O
But O
the O
General O
had O
avowed O
to O
me O
that, O
over O
and O
above O
such O
considerations O
as O
these, O
there O
were O
circumstances O
which O
compelled O
him O
to O
"move O
with O
especial O
care O
at O
present", O
and O
that O
the O
fact O
had O
actually O
made O
him O
poor-spirited O
and O
a O
coward--it O
had O
made O
him O
altogether O
change O
his O
tone O
towards O
me. O
This O
fact O
I O
took O
into O
my O
calculations, O
and O
duly O
noted O
it, O
for, O
of O
course, O
he O
MIGHT O
apply O
to O
the O
authorities O
tomorrow, O
and O
it O
behoved O
me O
to O
go O
carefully. O
Yet O
it O
was O
not O
the O
General O
but O
Polina PERSON
that O
I O
wanted O
to O
anger. O
She O
had O
treated O
me O
with O
such O
cruelty, O
and O
had O
got O
me O
into O
such O
a O
hole, O
that O
I O
felt O
a O
longing O
to O
force O
her O
to O
beseech O
me O
to O
stop. O
Of O
course, O
my O
tomfoolery O
might O
compromise O
her; O
yet O
certain O
other O
feelings O
and O
desires O
had O
begun O
to O
form O
themselves O
in O
my O
brain. O
If O
I O
was O
never O
to O
rank O
in O
her O
eyes O
as O
anything O
but O
a O
nonentity, O
it O
would O
not O
greatly O
matter O
if O
I O
figured O
as O
a O
draggle-tailed O
cockerel, O
and O
the O
Baron O
were O
to O
give O
me O
a O
good O
thrashing; O
but, O
the O
fact O
was O
that O
I O
desired O
to O
have O
the O
laugh O
of O
them O
all, O
and O
to O
come O
out O
myself O
unscathed. O
Let O
people O
see O
what O
they O
WOULD O
see. O
Let O
Polina, O
for O
once, O
have O
a O
good O
fright, O
and O
be O
forced O
to O
whistle O
me O
to O
heel O
again. O
But, O
however O
much O
she O
might O
whistle, O
she O
should O
see O
that O
I O
was O
at O
least O
no O
draggle-tailed O
cockerel! O
* O
* O
* O
* O
* O
I O
have O
just O
received O
a O
surprising O
piece O
of O
news. O
I O
have O
just O
met O
our O
chambermaid O
on O
the O
stairs, O
and O
been O
informed O
by O
her O
that O
Maria PERSON
Philipovna PERSON
departed O
today, O
by O
the O
night O
train, O
to O
stay O
with O
a O
cousin O
at O
Carlsbad. O
What O
can O
that O
mean? O
The O
maid O
declares O
that O
Madame O
packed O
her O
trunks O
early O
in O
the O
day. O
Yet O
how O
is O
it O
that O
no O
one O
else O
seems O
to O
have O
been O
aware O
of O
the O
circumstance? O
Or O
is O
it O
that O
I O
have O
been O
the O
only O
person O
to O
be O
unaware O
of O
it? O
Also, O
the O
maid O
has O
just O
told O
me O
that, O
three O
days O
ago, O
Maria PERSON
Philipovna PERSON
had O
some O
high O
words O
with O
the O
General. O
I O
understand, O
then! O
Probably O
the O
words O
were O
concerning O
Mlle. O
Blanche. O
Certainly O
something O
decisive O
is O
approaching. O
VII O
In O
the O
morning O
I O
sent O
for O
the O
maitre O
d'hotel, O
and O
explained O
to O
him O
that, O
in O
future, O
my O
bill O
was O
to O
be O
rendered O
to O
me O
personally. O
As O
a O
matter O
of O
fact, O
my O
expenses O
had O
never O
been O
so O
large O
as O
to O
alarm O
me, O
nor O
to O
lead O
me O
to O
quit O
the O
hotel; O
while, O
moreover, O
I O
still O
had O
160 O
gulden O
left O
to O
me, O
and--in O
them--yes, O
in O
them, O
perhaps, O
riches O
awaited O
me. O
It O
was O
a O
curious O
fact, O
that, O
though O
I O
had O
not O
yet O
won O
anything O
at O
play, O
I O
nevertheless O
acted, O
thought, O
and O
felt O
as O
though O
I O
were O
sure, O
before O
long, O
to O
become O
wealthy--since O
I O
could O
not O
imagine O
myself O
otherwise. O
Next, O
I O
bethought O
me, O
despite O
the O
earliness O
of O
the O
hour, O
of O
going O
to O
see O
Mr. O
Astley, O
who O
was O
staying O
at O
the O
Hotel O
de O
l'Angleterre O
(a O
hostelry O
at O
no O
great O
distance O
from O
our O
own). O
But O
suddenly O
De PERSON
Griers PERSON
entered O
my O
room. O
This O
had O
never O
before O
happened, O
for O
of O
late O
that O
gentleman O
and O
I O
had O
stood O
on O
the O
most O
strained O
and O
distant O
of O
terms--he O
attempting O
no O
concealment O
of O
his O
contempt O
for O
me O
(he O
even O
made O
an O
express, O
point O
of O
showing O
it), O
and O
I O
having O
no O
reason O
to O
desire O
his O
company. O
In O
short, O
I O
detested O
him. O
Consequently, O
his O
entry O
at O
the O
present O
moment O
the O
more O
astounded O
me. O
At O
once O
I O
divined O
that O
something O
out O
of O
the O
way O
was O
on O
the O
carpet. O
He O
entered O
with O
marked O
affability, O
and O
began O
by O
complimenting O
me O
on O
my O
room. O
Then, O
perceiving O
that O
I O
had O
my O
hat O
in O
my O
hands, O
he O
inquired O
whither O
I O
was O
going O
so O
early; O
and, O
no O
sooner O
did O
he O
hear O
that O
I O
was O
bound O
for O
Mr. O
Astley's O
than O
he O
stopped, O
looked O
grave, O
and O
seemed O
plunged O
in O
thought. O
He O
was O
a O
true O
Frenchman O
insofar O
as O
that, O
though O
he O
could O
be O
lively O
and O
engaging O
when O
it O
suited O
him, O
he O
became O
insufferably O
dull O
and O
wearisome O
as O
soon O
as O
ever O
the O
need O
for O
being O
lively O
and O
engaging O
had O
passed. O
Seldom O
is O
a O
Frenchman O
NATURALLY O
civil: O
he O
is O
civil O
only O
as O
though O
to O
order O
and O
of O
set O
purpose. O
Also, O
if O
he O
thinks O
it O
incumbent O
upon O
him O
to O
be O
fanciful, O
original, O
and O
out O
of O
the O
way, O
his O
fancy O
always O
assumes O
a O
foolish, O
unnatural O
vein, O
for O
the O
reason O
that O
it O
is O
compounded O
of O
trite, O
hackneyed O
forms. O
In O
short, O
the O
natural O
Frenchman O
is O
a O
conglomeration O
of O
commonplace, O
petty, O
everyday O
positiveness, O
so O
that O
he O
is O
the O
most O
tedious O
person O
in O
the O
world.--Indeed, O
I O
believe O
that O
none O
but O
greenhorns O
and O
excessively O
Russian O
people O
feel O
an O
attraction O
towards O
the O
French; O
for, O
to O
any O
man O
of O
sensibility, O
such O
a O
compendium O
of O
outworn O
forms--a O
compendium O
which O
is O
built O
up O
of O
drawing-room O
manners, O
expansiveness, O
and O
gaiety--becomes O
at O
once O
over-noticeable O
and O
unbearable. O
"I O
have O
come O
to O
see O
you O
on O
business," O
De PERSON
Griers PERSON
began O
in O
a O
very O
off-hand, O
yet O
polite, O
tone; O
"nor O
will O
I O
seek O
to O
conceal O
from O
you O
the O
fact O
that O
I O
have O
come O
in O
the O
capacity O
of O
an O
emissary, O
of O
an O
intermediary, O
from O
the O
General. O
Having O
small O
knowledge O
of O
the O
Russian O
tongue, O
I O
lost O
most O
of O
what O
was O
said O
last O
night; O
but, O
the O
General O
has O
now O
explained O
matters, O
and O
I O
must O
confess O
that--" O
"See O
here, O
Monsieur O
de O
Griers," O
I O
interrupted. O
"I O
understand O
that O
you O
have O
undertaken O
to O
act O
in O
this O
affair O
as O
an O
intermediary. O
Of O
course O
I O
am O
only O
'un O
utchitel,' O
a O
tutor, O
and O
have O
never O
claimed O
to O
be O
an O
intimate O
of O
this O
household, O
nor O
to O
stand O
on O
at O
all O
familiar O
terms O
with O
it. O
Consequently, O
I O
do O
not O
know O
the O
whole O
of O
its O
circumstances. O
Yet O
pray O
explain O
to O
me O
this: O
have O
you O
yourself O
become O
one O
of O
its O
members, O
seeing O
that O
you O
are O
beginning O
to O
take O
such O
a O
part O
in O
everything, O
and O
are O
now O
present O
as O
an O
intermediary?" O
The O
Frenchman O
seemed O
not O
over-pleased O
at O
my O
question. O
It O
was O
one O
which O
was O
too O
outspoken O
for O
his O
taste--and O
he O
had O
no O
mind O
to O
be O
frank O
with O
me. O
"I O
am O
connected O
with O
the O
General," O
he O
said O
drily, O
"partly O
through O
business O
affairs, O
and O
partly O
through O
special O
circumstances. O
My O
principal O
has O
sent O
me O
merely O
to O
ask O
you O
to O
forego O
your O
intentions O
of O
last O
evening. O
What O
you O
contemplate O
is, O
I O
have O
no O
doubt, O
very O
clever; O
yet O
he O
has O
charged O
me O
to O
represent O
to O
you O
that O
you O
have O
not O
the O
slightest O
chance O
of O
succeeding O
in O
your O
end, O
since O
not O
only O
will O
the O
Baron O
refuse O
to O
receive O
you, O
but O
also O
he O
(the O
Baron) O
has O
at O
his O
disposal O
every O
possible O
means O
for O
obviating O
further O
unpleasantness O
from O
you. O
Surely O
you O
can O
see O
that O
yourself? O
What, O
then, O
would O
be O
the O
good O
of O
going O
on O
with O
it O
all? O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
the O
General O
promises O
that O
at O
the O
first O
favourable O
opportunity O
he O
will O
receive O
you O
back O
into O
his O
household, O
and, O
in O
the O
meantime, O
will O
credit O
you O
with O
your O
salary--with O
'vos O
appointements.' O
Surely O
that O
will O
suit O
you, O
will O
it O
not?" O
Very O
quietly O
I O
replied O
that O
he O
(the O
Frenchman) O
was O
labouring O
under O
a O
delusion; O
that O
perhaps, O
after O
all, O
I O
should O
not O
be O
expelled O
from O
the O
Baron's O
presence, O
but, O
on O
the O
contrary, O
be O
listened O
to; O
finally, O
that O
I O
should O
be O
glad O
if O
Monsieur PERSON
de PERSON
Griers PERSON
would O
confess O
that O
he O
was O
now O
visiting O
me O
merely O
in O
order O
to O
see O
how O
far O
I O
intended O
to O
go O
in O
the O
affair. O
"Good O
heavens!" O
cried O
de O
Griers. O
"Seeing O
that O
the O
General O
takes O
such O
an O
interest O
in O
the O
matter, O
is O
there O
anything O
very O
unnatural O
in O
his O
desiring O
also O
to O
know O
your O
plans?" O
Again O
I O
began O
my O
explanations, O
but O
the O
Frenchman O
only O
fidgeted O
and O
rolled O
his O
head O
about O
as O
he O
listened O
with O
an O
expression O
of O
manifest O
and O
unconcealed O
irony O
on O
his O
face. O
In O
short, O
he O
adopted O
a O
supercilious O
attitude. O
For O
my O
own O
part, O
I O
endeavoured O
to O
pretend O
that O
I O
took O
the O
affair O
very O
seriously. O
I O
declared O
that, O
since O
the O
Baron O
had O
gone O
and O
complained O
of O
me O
to O
the O
General, O
as O
though O
I O
were O
a O
mere O
servant O
of O
the O
General's, O
he O
had, O
in O
the O
first O
place, O
lost O
me O
my O
post, O
and, O
in O
the O
second O
place, O
treated O
me O
like O
a O
person O
to O
whom, O
as O
to O
one O
not O
qualified O
to O
answer O
for O
himself, O
it O
was O
not O
even O
worth O
while O
to O
speak. O
Naturally, O
I O
said, O
I O
felt O
insulted O
at O
this. O
Yet, O
comprehending O
as O
I O
did, O
differences O
of O
years, O
of O
social O
status, O
and O
so O
forth O
(here O
I O
could O
scarcely O
help O
smiling), O
I O
was O
not O
anxious O
to O
bring O
about O
further O
scenes O
by O
going O
personally O
to O
demand O
or O
to O
request O
satisfaction O
of O
the O
Baron. O
All O
that O
I O
felt O
was O
that O
I O
had O
a O
right O
to O
go O
in O
person O
and O
beg O
the O
Baron's O
and O
the O
Baroness's O
pardon--the O
more O
so O
since, O
of O
late, O
I O
had O
been O
feeling O
unwell O
and O
unstrung, O
and O
had O
been O
in O
a O
fanciful O
condition. O
And O
so O
forth, O
and O
so O
forth. O
Yet O
(I O
continued) O
the O
Baron's O
offensive O
behaviour O
to O
me O
of O
yesterday O
(that O
is O
to O
say, O
the O
fact O
of O
his O
referring O
the O
matter O
to O
the O
General) O
as O
well O
as O
his O
insistence O
that O
the O
General O
should O
deprive O
me O
of O
my O
post, O
had O
placed O
me O
in O
such O
a O
position O
that O
I O
could O
not O
well O
express O
my O
regret O
to O
him O
(the O
Baron) O
and O
to O
his O
good O
lady, O
for O
the O
reason O
that O
in O
all O
probability O
both O
he O
and O
the O
Baroness, O
with O
the O
world O
at O
large, O
would O
imagine O
that O
I O
was O
doing O
so O
merely O
because O
I O
hoped, O
by O
my O
action, O
to O
recover O
my O
post. O
Hence, O
I O
found O
myself O
forced O
to O
request O
the O
Baron O
to O
express O
to O
me O
HIS O
OWN O
regrets, O
as O
well O
as O
to O
express O
them O
in O
the O
most O
unqualified O
manner--to O
say, O
in O
fact, O
that O
he O
had O
never O
had O
any O
wish O
to O
insult O
me. O
After O
the O
Baron O
had O
done O
THAT, O
I O
should, O
for O
my O
part, O
at O
once O
feel O
free O
to O
express O
to O
him, O
whole-heartedly O
and O
without O
reserve, O
my O
own O
regrets. O
"In O
short," O
I O
declared O
in O
conclusion, O
"my O
one O
desire O
is O
that O
the O
Baron O
may O
make O
it O
possible O
for O
me O
to O
adopt O
the O
latter O
course." O
"Oh O
fie! O
What O
refinements O
and O
subtleties!" O
exclaimed O
De O
Griers. O
"Besides, O
what O
have O
you O
to O
express O
regret O
for? O
Confess, O
Monsieur, O
Monsieur--pardon O
me, O
but O
I O
have O
forgotten O
your O
name--confess, O
I O
say, O
that O
all O
this O
is O
merely O
a O
plan O
to O
annoy O
the O
General? O
Or O
perhaps, O
you O
have O
some O
other O
and O
special O
end O
in O
view? O
Eh?" O
"In O
return O
you O
must O
pardon O
ME, O
mon O
cher O
Marquis, O
and O
tell O
me O
what O
you O
have O
to O
do O
with O
it." O
"The O
General--" O
"But O
what O
of O
the O
General? O
Last O
night O
he O
said O
that, O
for O
some O
reason O
or O
another, O
it O
behoved O
him O
to O
'move O
with O
especial O
care O
at O
present;' O
wherefore, O
he O
was O
feeling O
nervous. O
But O
I O
did O
not O
understand O
the O
reference." O
"Yes, O
there O
DO O
exist O
special O
reasons O
for O
his O
doing O
so," O
assented O
De PERSON
Griers PERSON
in O
a O
conciliatory O
tone, O
yet O
with O
rising O
anger. O
"You O
are O
acquainted O
with O
Mlle. O
de O
Cominges, O
are O
you O
not?" O
"Mlle. O
Blanche, O
you O
mean?" O
"Yes, O
Mlle. O
Blanche O
de O
Cominges. O
Doubtless O
you O
know O
also O
that O
the O
General O
is O
in O
love O
with O
this O
young O
lady, O
and O
may O
even O
be O
about O
to O
marry O
her O
before O
he O
leaves O
here? O
Imagine, O
therefore, O
what O
any O
scene O
or O
scandal O
would O
entail O
upon O
him!" O
"I O
cannot O
see O
that O
the O
marriage O
scheme O
need, O
be O
affected O
by O
scenes O
or O
scandals." O
"Mais O
le O
Baron O
est O
si O
irascible--un O
caractere O
prussien, O
vous O
savez! O
Enfin O
il O
fera O
une O
querelle O
d'Allemand." O
"I O
do O
not O
care," O
I O
replied, O
"seeing O
that O
I O
no O
longer O
belong O
to O
his O
household" O
(of O
set O
purpose O
I O
was O
trying O
to O
talk O
as O
senselessly O
as O
possible). O
"But O
is O
it O
quite O
settled O
that O
Mlle. O
is O
to O
marry O
the O
General? O
What O
are O
they O
waiting O
for? O
Why O
should O
they O
conceal O
such O
a O
matter--at O
all O
events O
from O
ourselves, O
the O
General's O
own O
party?" O
"I O
cannot O
tell O
you. O
The O
marriage O
is O
not O
yet O
a O
settled O
affair, O
for O
they O
are O
awaiting O
news O
from O
Russia. LOCATION
The O
General O
has O
business O
transactions O
to O
arrange." O
"Ah! O
Connected, O
doubtless, O
with O
madame O
his O
mother?" O
De PERSON
Griers PERSON
shot O
at O
me O
a O
glance O
of O
hatred. O
"To O
cut O
things O
short," O
he O
interrupted, O
"I O
have O
complete O
confidence O
in O
your O
native O
politeness, O
as O
well O
as O
in O
your O
tact O
and O
good O
sense. O
I O
feel O
sure O
that O
you O
will O
do O
what O
I O
suggest, O
even O
if O
it O
is O
only O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
this O
family O
which O
has O
received O
you O
as O
a O
kinsman O
into O
its O
bosom O
and O
has O
always O
loved O
and O
respected O
you." O
"Be O
so O
good O
as O
to O
observe," O
I O
remarked, O
"that O
the O
same O
family O
has O
just O
EXPELLED O
me O
from O
its O
bosom. O
All O
that O
you O
are O
saying O
you O
are O
saying O
but O
for O
show; O
but, O
when O
people O
have O
just O
said O
to O
you, O
'Of O
course O
we O
do O
not O
wish O
to O
turn O
you O
out, O
yet, O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
appearance's, O
you O
must O
PERMIT O
yourself O
to O
be O
turned O
out,' O
nothing O
can O
matter O
very O
much." O
"Very O
well, O
then," O
he O
said, O
in O
a O
sterner O
and O
more O
arrogant O
tone. O
"Seeing O
that O
my O
solicitations O
have O
had O
no O
effect O
upon O
you, O
it O
is O
my O
duty O
to O
mention O
that O
other O
measures O
will O
be O
taken. O
There O
exist O
here O
police, O
you O
must O
remember, O
and O
this O
very O
day O
they O
shall O
send O
you O
packing. O
Que O
diable! O
To O
think O
of O
a O
blanc O
bec O
like O
yourself O
challenging O
a O
person O
like O
the O
Baron O
to O
a O
duel! O
Do O
you O
suppose O
that O
you O
will O
be O
ALLOWED O
to O
do O
such O
things? O
Just O
try O
doing O
them, O
and O
see O
if O
any O
one O
will O
be O
afraid O
of O
you! O
The O
reason O
why O
I O
have O
asked O
you O
to O
desist O
is O
that O
I O
can O
see O
that O
your O
conduct O
is O
causing O
the O
General O
annoyance. O
Do O
you O
believe O
that O
the O
Baron PERSON
could O
not O
tell O
his O
lacquey O
simply O
to O
put O
you O
out O
of O
doors?" O
"Nevertheless O
I O
should O
not O
GO O
out O
of O
doors," O
I O
retorted O
with O
absolute O
calm. O
"You O
are O
labouring O
under O
a O
delusion, O
Monsieur O
de O
Griers. O
The O
thing O
will O
be O
done O
in O
far O
better O
trim O
than O
you O
imagine. O
I O
was O
just O
about O
to O
start O
for O
Mr. O
Astley's, O
to O
ask O
him O
to O
be O
my O
intermediary--in O
other O
words, O
my O
second. O
He O
has O
a O
strong O
liking O
for O
me, O
and O
I O
do O
not O
think O
that O
he O
will O
refuse. O
He O
will O
go O
and O
see O
the O
Baron O
on O
MY O
behalf, O
and O
the O
Baron PERSON
will O
certainly O
not O
decline O
to O
receive O
him. O
Although O
I O
am O
only O
a O
tutor--a O
kind O
of O
subaltern, O
Mr. O
Astley PERSON
is O
known O
to O
all O
men O
as O
the O
nephew O
of O
a O
real O
English O
lord, O
the O
Lord O
Piebroch, O
as O
well O
as O
a O
lord O
in O
his O
own O
right. O
Yes, O
you O
may O
be O
pretty O
sure O
that O
the O
Baron PERSON
will O
be O
civil O
to O
Mr. O
Astley, O
and O
listen O
to O
him. O
Or, O
should O
he O
decline O
to O
do O
so, O
Mr. O
Astley PERSON
will O
take O
the O
refusal O
as O
a O
personal O
affront O
to O
himself O
(for O
you O
know O
how O
persistent O
the O
English O
are?) O
and O
thereupon O
introduce O
to O
the O
Baron O
a O
friend O
of O
his O
own O
(and O
he O
has O
many O
friends O
in O
a O
good O
position). O
That O
being O
so, O
picture O
to O
yourself O
the O
issue O
of O
the O
affair--an O
affair O
which O
will O
not O
quite O
end O
as O
you O
think O
it O
will." O
This O
caused O
the O
Frenchman O
to O
bethink O
him O
of O
playing O
the O
coward. O
"Really O
things O
may O
be O
as O
this O
fellow O
says," O
he O
evidently O
thought. O
"Really O
he O
MIGHT O
be O
able O
to O
engineer O
another O
scene." O
"Once O
more O
I O
beg O
of O
you O
to O
let O
the O
matter O
drop," O
he O
continued O
in O
a O
tone O
that O
was O
now O
entirely O
conciliatory. O
"One O
would O
think O
that O
it O
actually O
PLEASED O
you O
to O
have O
scenes! O
Indeed, O
it O
is O
a O
brawl O
rather O
than O
genuine O
satisfaction O
that O
you O
are O
seeking. O
I O
have O
said O
that O
the O
affair O
may O
prove O
to O
be O
diverting, O
and O
even O
clever, O
and O
that O
possibly O
you O
may O
attain O
something O
by O
it; O
yet O
none O
the O
less O
I O
tell O
you" O
(he O
said O
this O
only O
because O
he O
saw O
me O
rise O
and O
reach O
for O
my O
hat) O
"that O
I O
have O
come O
hither O
also O
to O
hand O
you O
these O
few O
words O
from O
a O
certain O
person. O
Read O
them, O
please, O
for O
I O
must O
take O
her O
back O
an O
answer." O
So O
saying, O
he O
took O
from O
his O
pocket O
a O
small, O
compact, O
wafer-sealed O
note, O
and O
handed O
it O
to O
me. O
In O
Polina's O
handwriting O
I O
read: O
"I O
hear O
that O
you O
are O
thinking O
of O
going O
on O
with O
this O
affair. O
You O
have O
lost O
your O
temper O
now, O
and O
are O
beginning O
to O
play O
the O
fool! O
Certain O
circumstances, O
however, O
I O
may O
explain O
to O
you O
later. O
Pray O
cease O
from O
your O
folly, O
and O
put O
a O
check O
upon O
yourself. O
For O
folly O
it O
all O
is. O
I O
have O
need O
of O
you, O
and, O
moreover, O
you O
have O
promised O
to O
obey O
me. O
Remember O
the O
Shlangenberg. O
I O
ask O
you O
to O
be O
obedient. O
If O
necessary, O
I O
shall O
even O
BID O
you O
be O
obedient.--Your O
own----POLINA. O
"P.S.--If O
so O
be O
that O
you O
still O
bear O
a O
grudge O
against O
me O
for O
what O
happened O
last O
night, O
pray O
forgive O
me." O
Everything, O
to O
my O
eyes, O
seemed O
to O
change O
as O
I O
read O
these O
words. O
My O
lips O
grew O
pale, O
and O
I O
began O
to O
tremble. O
Meanwhile, O
the O
cursed O
Frenchman O
was O
eyeing O
me O
discreetly O
and O
askance, O
as O
though O
he O
wished O
to O
avoid O
witnessing O
my O
confusion. O
It O
would O
have O
been O
better O
if O
he O
had O
laughed O
outright. O
"Very O
well," O
I O
said, O
"you O
can O
tell O
Mlle. O
not O
to O
disturb O
herself. O
But," O
I O
added O
sharply, O
"I O
would O
also O
ask O
you O
why O
you O
have O
been O
so O
long O
in O
handing O
me O
this O
note? O
Instead O
of O
chattering O
about O
trifles, O
you O
ought O
to O
have O
delivered O
me O
the O
missive O
at O
once--if O
you O
have O
really O
come O
commissioned O
as O
you O
say." O
"Well, O
pardon O
some O
natural O
haste O
on O
my O
part, O
for O
the O
situation O
is O
so O
strange. O
I O
wished O
first O
to O
gain O
some O
personal O
knowledge O
of O
your O
intentions; O
and, O
moreover, O
I O
did O
not O
know O
the O
contents O
of O
the O
note, O
and O
thought O
that O
it O
could O
be O
given O
you O
at O
any O
time." O
"I O
understand," O
I O
replied. O
"So O
you O
were O
ordered O
to O
hand O
me O
the O
note O
only O
in O
the O
last O
resort, O
and O
if O
you O
could O
not O
otherwise O
appease O
me? O
Is O
it O
not O
so? O
Speak O
out, O
Monsieur O
de O
Griers." O
"Perhaps," O
said O
he, O
assuming O
a O
look O
of O
great O
forbearance, O
but O
gazing O
at O
me O
in O
a O
meaning O
way. O
I O
reached O
for O
my O
hat; O
whereupon O
he O
nodded, O
and O
went O
out. O
Yet O
on O
his O
lips O
I O
fancied O
that O
I O
could O
see O
a O
mocking O
smile. O
How O
could O
it O
have O
been O
otherwise? O
"You O
and O
I O
are O
to O
have O
a O
reckoning O
later, O
Master O
Frenchman," O
I O
muttered O
as O
I O
descended O
the O
stairs. O
"Yes, O
we O
will O
measure O
our O
strength O
together." O
Yet O
my O
thoughts O
were O
all O
in O
confusion, O
for O
again O
something O
seemed O
to O
have O
struck O
me O
dizzy. O
Presently O
the O
air O
revived O
me O
a O
little, O
and, O
a O
couple O
of O
minutes O
later, O
my O
brain O
had O
sufficiently O
cleared O
to O
enable O
two O
ideas O
in O
particular O
to O
stand O
out O
in O
it. O
Firstly, O
I O
asked O
myself, O
which O
of O
the O
absurd, O
boyish, O
and O
extravagant O
threats O
which O
I O
had O
uttered O
at O
random O
last O
night O
had O
made O
everybody O
so O
alarmed? O
Secondly, O
what O
was O
the O
influence O
which O
this O
Frenchman O
appeared O
to O
exercise O
over O
Polina? O
He O
had O
but O
to O
give O
the O
word, O
and O
at O
once O
she O
did O
as O
he O
desired--at O
once O
she O
wrote O
me O
a O
note O
to O
beg O
of O
me O
to O
forbear! O
Of O
course, O
the O
relations O
between O
the O
pair O
had, O
from O
the O
first, O
been O
a O
riddle O
to O
me--they O
had O
been O
so O
ever O
since O
I O
had O
first O
made O
their O
acquaintance. O
But O
of O
late O
I O
had O
remarked O
in O
her O
a O
strong O
aversion O
for, O
even O
a O
contempt O
for--him, O
while, O
for O
his O
part, O
he O
had O
scarcely O
even O
looked O
at O
her, O
but O
had O
behaved O
towards O
her O
always O
in O
the O
most O
churlish O
fashion. O
Yes, O
I O
had O
noted O
that. O
Also, O
Polina O
herself O
had O
mentioned O
to O
me O
her O
dislike O
for O
him, O
and O
delivered O
herself O
of O
some O
remarkable O
confessions O
on O
the O
subject. O
Hence, O
he O
must O
have O
got O
her O
into O
his O
power O
somehow--somehow O
he O
must O
be O
holding O
her O
as O
in O
a O
vice. O
VIII O
All O
at O
once, O
on O
the O
Promenade, O
as O
it O
was O
called--that O
is O
to O
say, O
in O
the O
Chestnut O
Avenue--I O
came O
face O
to O
face O
with O
my O
Englishman. O
"I O
was O
just O
coming O
to O
see O
you," O
he O
said; O
"and O
you O
appear O
to O
be O
out O
on O
a O
similar O
errand. O
So O
you O
have O
parted O
with O
your O
employers?" O
"How O
do O
you O
know O
that?" O
I O
asked O
in O
astonishment. O
"Is O
EVERY O
ONE O
aware O
of O
the O
fact?" O
"By O
no O
means. O
Not O
every O
one O
would O
consider O
such O
a O
fact O
to O
be O
of O
moment. O
Indeed, O
I O
have O
never O
heard O
any O
one O
speak O
of O
it." O
"Then O
how O
come O
you O
to O
know O
it?" O
"Because O
I O
have O
had O
occasion O
to O
do O
so. O
Whither O
are O
you O
bound? O
I O
like O
you, O
and O
was O
therefore O
coming O
to O
pay O
you O
a O
visit." O
"What O
a O
splendid O
fellow O
you O
are, O
Mr. O
Astley!" O
I O
cried, O
though O
still O
wondering O
how O
he O
had O
come O
by O
his O
knowledge. O
"And O
since O
I O
have O
not O
yet O
had O
my O
coffee, O
and O
you O
have, O
in O
all O
probability, O
scarcely O
tasted O
yours, O
let O
us O
adjourn O
to O
the O
Casino O
Cafe, O
where O
we O
can O
sit O
and O
smoke O
and O
have O
a O
talk." O
The O
cafe O
in O
question O
was O
only O
a O
hundred O
paces O
away; O
so, O
when O
coffee O
had O
been O
brought, O
we O
seated O
ourselves, O
and O
I O
lit O
a O
cigarette. O
Astley PERSON
was O
no O
smoker, O
but, O
taking O
a O
seat O
by O
my O
side, O
he O
prepared O
himself O
to O
listen. O
"I O
do O
not O
intend O
to O
go O
away," O
was O
my O
first O
remark. O
"I O
intend, O
on O
the O
contrary, O
to O
remain O
here." O
"That O
I O
never O
doubted," O
he O
answered O
good-humouredly. O
It O
is O
a O
curious O
fact O
that, O
on O
my O
way O
to O
see O
him, O
I O
had O
never O
even O
thought O
of O
telling O
him O
of O
my O
love O
for O
Polina. O
In O
fact, O
I O
had O
purposely O
meant O
to O
avoid O
any O
mention O
of O
the O
subject. O
Nor, O
during O
our O
stay O
in O
the O
place, O
had O
I O
ever O
made O
aught O
but O
the O
scantiest O
reference O
to O
it. O
You O
see, O
not O
only O
was O
Astley PERSON
a O
man O
of O
great O
reserve, O
but O
also O
from O
the O
first O
I O
had O
perceived O
that O
Polina PERSON
had O
made O
a O
great O
impression O
upon O
him, O
although O
he O
never O
spoke O
of O
her. O
But O
now, O
strangely O
enough, O
he O
had O
no O
sooner O
seated O
himself O
and O
bent O
his O
steely O
gaze O
upon O
me, O
than, O
for O
some O
reason O
or O
another, O
I O
felt O
moved O
to O
tell O
him O
everything--to O
speak O
to O
him O
of O
my O
love O
in O
all O
its O
phases. O
For O
an O
hour O
and O
a O
half O
did O
I O
discourse O
on O
the O
subject, O
and O
found O
it O
a O
pleasure O
to O
do O
so, O
even O
though O
this O
was O
the O
first O
occasion O
on O
which O
I O
had O
referred O
to O
the O
matter. O
Indeed, O
when, O
at O
certain O
moments, O
I O
perceived O
that O
my O
more O
ardent O
passages O
confused O
him, O
I O
purposely O
increased O
my O
ardour O
of O
narration. O
Yet O
one O
thing O
I O
regret: O
and O
that O
is O
that O
I O
made O
references O
to O
the O
Frenchman O
which O
were O
a O
little O
over-personal. O
Mr. O
Astley PERSON
sat O
without O
moving O
as O
he O
listened O
to O
me. O
Not O
a O
word O
nor O
a O
sound O
of O
any O
kind O
did O
he O
utter O
as O
he O
stared O
into O
my O
eyes. O
Suddenly, O
however, O
on O
my O
mentioning O
the O
Frenchman, O
he O
interrupted O
me, O
and O
inquired O
sternly O
whether O
I O
did O
right O
to O
speak O
of O
an O
extraneous O
matter O
(he O
had O
always O
been O
a O
strange O
man O
in O
his O
mode O
of O
propounding O
questions). O
"No, O
I O
fear O
not," O
I O
replied. O
"And O
concerning O
this O
Marquis PERSON
and O
Mlle. O
Polina PERSON
you O
know O
nothing O
beyond O
surmise?" O
Again O
I O
was O
surprised O
that O
such O
a O
categorical O
question O
should O
come O
from O
such O
a O
reserved O
individual. O
"No, O
I O
know O
nothing O
FOR O
CERTAIN O
about O
them" O
was O
my O
reply. O
"No--nothing." O
"Then O
you O
have O
done O
very O
wrong O
to O
speak O
of O
them O
to O
me, O
or O
even O
to O
imagine O
things O
about O
them." O
"Quite O
so, O
quite O
so," O
I O
interrupted O
in O
some O
astonishment. O
"I O
admit O
that. O
Yet O
that O
is O
not O
the O
question." O
Whereupon O
I O
related O
to O
him O
in O
detail O
the O
incident O
of O
two O
days O
ago. O
I O
spoke O
of O
Polina's O
outburst, O
of O
my O
encounter O
with O
the O
Baron, O
of O
my O
dismissal, O
of O
the O
General's O
extraordinary O
pusillanimity, O
and O
of O
the O
call O
which O
De PERSON
Griers PERSON
had O
that O
morning O
paid O
me. O
In O
conclusion, O
I O
showed O
Astley PERSON
the O
note O
which O
I O
had O
lately O
received. O
"What O
do O
you O
make O
of O
it?" O
I O
asked. O
"When O
I O
met O
you O
I O
was O
just O
coming O
to O
ask O
you O
your O
opinion. O
For O
myself, O
I O
could O
have O
killed O
this O
Frenchman, O
and O
am O
not O
sure O
that O
I O
shall O
not O
do O
so O
even O
yet." O
"I O
feel O
the O
same O
about O
it," O
said O
Mr. O
Astley. O
"As O
for O
Mlle. O
Polina--well, O
you O
yourself O
know O
that, O
if O
necessity O
drives, O
one O
enters O
into O
relation O
with O
people O
whom O
one O
simply O
detests. O
Even O
between O
this O
couple O
there O
may O
be O
something O
which, O
though O
unknown O
to O
you, O
depends O
upon O
extraneous O
circumstances. O
For, O
my O
own O
part, O
I O
think O
that O
you O
may O
reassure O
yourself--or O
at O
all O
events O
partially. O
And O
as O
for O
Mlle. O
Polina's O
proceedings O
of O
two O
days O
ago, O
they O
were, O
of O
course, O
strange; O
not O
because O
she O
can O
have O
meant O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
you, O
or O
to O
earn O
for O
you O
a O
thrashing O
from O
the O
Baron's O
cudgel O
(which O
for O
some O
curious O
reason, O
he O
did O
not O
use, O
although O
he O
had O
it O
ready O
in O
his O
hands), O
but O
because O
such O
proceedings O
on O
the O
part O
of O
such--well, O
of O
such O
a O
refined O
lady O
as O
Mlle. O
Polina PERSON
are, O
to O
say O
the O
least O
of O
it, O
unbecoming. O
But O
she O
cannot O
have O
guessed O
that O
you O
would O
carry O
out O
her O
absurd O
wish O
to O
the O
letter?" O
"Do O
you O
know O
what?" O
suddenly O
I O
cried O
as O
I O
fixed O
Mr. O
Astley PERSON
with O
my O
gaze. O
"I O
believe O
that O
you O
have O
already O
heard O
the O
story O
from O
some O
one--very O
possibly O
from O
Mlle. O
Polina PERSON
herself?" O
In O
return O
he O
gave O
me O
an O
astonished O
stare. O
"Your O
eyes O
look O
very O
fiery," O
he O
said O
with O
a O
return O
of O
his O
former O
calm, O
"and O
in O
them O
I O
can O
read O
suspicion. O
Now, O
you O
have O
no O
right O
whatever O
to O
be O
suspicious. O
It O
is O
not O
a O
right O
which O
I O
can O
for O
a O
moment O
recognise, O
and O
I O
absolutely O
refuse O
to O
answer O
your O
questions." O
"Enough! O
You O
need O
say O
no O
more," O
I O
cried O
with O
a O
strange O
emotion O
at O
my O
heart, O
yet O
not O
altogether O
understanding O
what O
had O
aroused O
that O
emotion O
in O
my O
breast. O
Indeed, O
when, O
where, O
and O
how O
could O
Polina PERSON
have O
chosen O
Astley PERSON
to O
be O
one O
of O
her O
confidants? O
Of O
late O
I O
had O
come O
rather O
to O
overlook O
him O
in O
this O
connection, O
even O
though O
Polina PERSON
had O
always O
been O
a O
riddle O
to O
me--so O
much O
so O
that O
now, O
when O
I O
had O
just O
permitted O
myself O
to O
tell O
my O
friend O
of O
my O
infatuation O
in O
all O
its O
aspects, O
I O
had O
found O
myself O
struck, O
during O
the O
very O
telling, O
with O
the O
fact O
that O
in O
my O
relations O
with O
her O
I O
could O
specify O
nothing O
that O
was O
explicit, O
nothing O
that O
was O
positive. O
On O
the O
contrary, O
my O
relations O
had O
been O
purely O
fantastic, O
strange, O
and O
unreal; O
they O
had O
been O
unlike O
anything O
else O
that O
I O
could O
think O
of. O
"Very O
well, O
very O
well," O
I O
replied O
with O
a O
warmth O
equal O
to O
Astley's O
own. O
"Then O
I O
stand O
confounded, O
and O
have O
no O
further O
opinions O
to O
offer. O
But O
you O
are O
a O
good O
fellow, O
and O
I O
am O
glad O
to O
know O
what O
you O
think O
about O
it O
all, O
even O
though O
I O
do O
not O
need O
your O
advice." O
Then, O
after O
a O
pause, O
I O
resumed: O
"For O
instance, O
what O
reason O
should O
you O
assign O
for O
the O
General O
taking O
fright O
in O
this O
way? O
Why O
should O
my O
stupid O
clowning O
have O
led O
the O
world O
to O
elevate O
it O
into O
a O
serious O
incident? O
Even O
De PERSON
Griers PERSON
has O
found O
it O
necessary O
to O
put O
in O
his O
oar O
(and O
he O
only O
interferes O
on O
the O
most O
important O
occasions), O
and O
to O
visit O
me, O
and O
to O
address O
to O
me O
the O
most O
earnest O
supplications. O
Yes, O
HE, O
De O
Griers, O
has O
actually O
been O
playing O
the O
suppliant O
to O
ME! O
And, O
mark O
you, O
although O
he O
came O
to O
me O
as O
early O
as O
nine O
o'clock, O
he O
had O
ready-prepared O
in O
his O
hand O
Mlle. O
Polina's O
note. O
When, O
I O
would O
ask, O
was O
that O
note O
written? O
Mlle. O
Polina PERSON
must O
have O
been O
aroused O
from O
sleep O
for O
the O
express O
purpose O
of O
writing O
it. O
At O
all O
events O
the O
circumstance O
shows O
that O
she O
is O
an O
absolute O
slave O
to O
the O
Frenchman, O
since O
she O
actually O
begs O
my O
pardon O
in O
the O
note--actually O
begs O
my O
pardon! O
Yet O
what O
is O
her O
personal O
concern O
in O
the O
matter? O
Why O
is O
she O
interested O
in O
it O
at O
all? O
Why, O
too, O
is O
the O
whole O
party O
so O
afraid O
of O
this O
precious O
Baron? O
And O
what O
sort O
of O
a O
business O
do O
you O
call O
it O
for O
the O
General O
to O
be O
going O
to O
marry O
Mlle. O
Blanche O
de O
Cominges? O
He O
told O
me O
last O
night O
that, O
because O
of O
the O
circumstance, O
he O
must O
'move O
with O
especial O
care O
at O
present.' O
What O
is O
your O
opinion O
of O
it O
all? O
Your O
look O
convinces O
me O
that O
you O
know O
more O
about O
it O
than O
I O
do." O
Mr. O
Astley PERSON
smiled O
and O
nodded. O
"Yes, O
I O
think O
I O
DO O
know O
more O
about O
it O
than O
you O
do," O
he O
assented. O
"The O
affair O
centres O
around O
this O
Mlle. O
Blanche. O
Of O
that O
I O
feel O
certain." O
"And O
what O
of O
Mlle. O
Blanche?" O
I O
cried O
impatiently O
(for O
in O
me O
there O
had O
dawned O
a O
sudden O
hope O
that O
this O
would O
enable O
me O
to O
discover O
something O
about O
Polina). O
"Well, O
my O
belief O
is O
that O
at O
the O
present O
moment O
Mlle. O
Blanche O
has, O
in O
very O
truth, O
a O
special O
reason O
for O
wishing O
to O
avoid O
any O
trouble O
with O
the O
Baron O
and O
the O
Baroness. O
It O
might O
lead O
not O
only O
to O
some O
unpleasantness, O
but O
even O
to O
a O
scandal." O
"Oh, O
oh!" O
"Also O
I O
may O
tell O
you O
that O
Mlle. O
Blanche PERSON
has O
been O
in O
Roulettenberg LOCATION
before, O
for O
she O
was O
staying O
here O
three O
seasons O
ago. O
I O
myself O
was O
in O
the O
place O
at O
the O
time, O
and O
in O
those O
days O
Mlle. O
Blanche PERSON
was O
not O
known O
as O
Mlle. O
de O
Cominges, O
nor O
was O
her O
mother, O
the O
Widow O
de O
Cominges, O
even O
in O
existence. O
In O
any O
case O
no O
one O
ever O
mentioned O
the O
latter. O
De O
Griers, O
too, O
had O
not O
materialised, O
and O
I O
am O
convinced O
that O
not O
only O
do O
the O
parties O
stand O
in O
no O
relation O
to O
one O
another, O
but O
also O
they O
have O
not O
long O
enjoyed O
one O
another's O
acquaintance. O
Likewise, O
the O
Marquisate O
de O
Griers O
is O
of O
recent O
creation. O
Of O
that O
I O
have O
reason O
to O
be O
sure, O
owing O
to O
a O
certain O
circumstance. O
Even O
the O
name O
De PERSON
Griers PERSON
itself O
may O
be O
taken O
to O
be O
a O
new O
invention, O
seeing O
that O
I O
have O
a O
friend O
who O
once O
met O
the O
said O
'Marquis' O
under O
a O
different O
name O
altogether." O
"Yet O
he O
possesses O
a O
good O
circle O
of O
friends?" O
"Possibly. O
Mlle. O
Blanche PERSON
also O
may O
possess O
that. O
Yet O
it O
is O
not O
three O
years O
since O
she O
received O
from O
the O
local O
police, O
at O
the O
instance O
of O
the O
Baroness, O
an O
invitation O
to O
leave O
the O
town. O
And O
she O
left O
it." O
"But O
why?" O
"Well, O
I O
must O
tell O
you O
that O
she O
first O
appeared O
here O
in O
company O
with O
an O
Italian--a O
prince O
of O
some O
sort, O
a O
man O
who O
bore O
an O
historic O
name O
(Barberini O
or O
something O
of O
the O
kind). O
The O
fellow O
was O
simply O
a O
mass O
of O
rings O
and O
diamonds--real O
diamonds, O
too--and O
the O
couple O
used O
to O
drive O
out O
in O
a O
marvellous O
carriage. O
At O
first O
Mlle. O
Blanche O
played O
'trente O
et O
quarante' O
with O
fair O
success, O
but, O
later, O
her O
luck O
took O
a O
marked O
change O
for O
the O
worse. O
I O
distinctly O
remember O
that O
in O
a O
single O
evening O
she O
lost O
an O
enormous O
sum. O
But O
worse O
was O
to O
ensue, O
for O
one O
fine O
morning O
her O
prince O
disappeared--horses, O
carriage, O
and O
all. O
Also, O
the O
hotel O
bill O
which O
he O
left O
unpaid O
was O
enormous. O
Upon O
this O
Mlle. O
Zelma PERSON
(the O
name O
which O
she O
assumed O
after O
figuring O
as O
Madame O
Barberini) O
was O
in O
despair. O
She O
shrieked O
and O
howled O
all O
over O
the O
hotel, O
and O
even O
tore O
her O
clothes O
in O
her O
frenzy. O
In O
the O
hotel O
there O
was O
staying O
also O
a O
Polish O
count O
(you O
must O
know O
that O
ALL O
travelling O
Poles O
are O
counts!), O
and O
the O
spectacle O
of O
Mlle. O
Zelma PERSON
tearing O
her O
clothes O
and, O
catlike, O
scratching O
her O
face O
with O
her O
beautiful, O
scented O
nails O
produced O
upon O
him O
a O
strong O
impression. O
So O
the O
pair O
had O
a O
talk O
together, O
and, O
by O
luncheon O
time, O
she O
was O
consoled. O
Indeed, O
that O
evening O
the O
couple O
entered O
the O
Casino O
arm-in-arm--Mlle. O
Zelma PERSON
laughing O
loudly, O
according O
to O
her O
custom, O
and O
showing O
even O
more O
expansiveness O
in O
her O
manners O
than O
she O
had O
before O
shown. O
For O
instance, O
she O
thrust O
her O
way O
into O
the O
file O
of O
women O
roulette-players O
in O
the O
exact O
fashion O
of O
those O
ladies O
who, O
to O
clear O
a O
space O
for O
themselves O
at O
the O
tables, O
push O
their O
fellow-players O
roughly O
aside. O
Doubtless O
you O
have O
noticed O
them?" O
"Yes, O
certainly." O
"Well, O
they O
are O
not O
worth O
noticing. O
To O
the O
annoyance O
of O
the O
decent O
public O
they O
are O
allowed O
to O
remain O
here--at O
all O
events O
such O
of O
them O
as O
daily O
change O
4000 O
franc O
notes O
at O
the O
tables O
(though, O
as O
soon O
as O
ever O
these O
women O
cease O
to O
do O
so, O
they O
receive O
an O
invitation O
to O
depart). O
However, O
Mlle. O
Zelma PERSON
continued O
to O
change O
notes O
of O
this O
kind, O
but O
her O
play O
grew O
more O
and O
more O
unsuccessful, O
despite O
the O
fact O
that O
such O
ladies' O
luck O
is O
frequently O
good, O
for O
they O
have O
a O
surprising O
amount O
of O
cash O
at O
their O
disposal. O
Suddenly, O
the O
Count O
too O
disappeared, O
even O
as O
the O
Prince O
had O
done, O
and O
that O
same O
evening O
Mlle. O
Zelma PERSON
was O
forced O
to O
appear O
in O
the O
Casino O
alone. O
On O
this O
occasion O
no O
one O
offered O
her O
a O
greeting. O
Two O
days O
later O
she O
had O
come O
to O
the O
end O
of O
her O
resources; O
whereupon, O
after O
staking O
and O
losing O
her O
last O
louis O
d'or O
she O
chanced O
to O
look O
around O
her, O
and O
saw O
standing O
by O
her O
side O
the O
Baron O
Burmergelm, O
who O
had O
been O
eyeing O
her O
with O
fixed O
disapproval. O
To O
his O
distaste, O
however, O
Mlle. O
paid O
no O
attention, O
but, O
turning O
to O
him O
with O
her O
well-known O
smile, O
requested O
him O
to O
stake, O
on O
her O
behalf, O
ten O
louis O
on O
the O
red. O
Later O
that O
evening O
a O
complaint O
from O
the O
Baroness PERSON
led O
the O
authorities O
to O
request O
Mlle. O
not O
to O
re-enter O
the O
Casino. O
If O
you O
feel O
in O
any O
way O
surprised O
that O
I O
should O
know O
these O
petty O
and O
unedifying O
details, O
the O
reason O
is O
that O
I O
had O
them O
from O
a O
relative O
of O
mine O
who, O
later O
that O
evening, O
drove O
Mlle. O
Zelma PERSON
in O
his O
carriage O
from O
Roulettenberg LOCATION
to O
Spa. O
Now, O
mark O
you, O
Mlle. O
wants O
to O
become O
Madame O
General, O
in O
order O
that, O
in O
future, O
she O
may O
be O
spared O
the O
receipt O
of O
such O
invitations O
from O
Casino O
authorities O
as O
she O
received O
three O
years O
ago. O
At O
present O
she O
is O
not O
playing; O
but O
that O
is O
only O
because, O
according O
to O
the O
signs, O
she O
is O
lending O
money O
to O
other O
players. O
Yes, O
that O
is O
a O
much O
more O
paying O
game. O
I O
even O
suspect O
that O
the O
unfortunate O
General O
is O
himself O
in O
her O
debt, O
as O
well O
as, O
perhaps, O
also O
De O
Griers. O
Or, O
it O
may O
be O
that O
the O
latter O
has O
entered O
into O
a O
partnership O
with O
her. O
Consequently O
you O
yourself O
will O
see O
that, O
until O
the O
marriage O
shall O
have O
been O
consummated, O
Mlle. O
would O
scarcely O
like O
to O
have O
the O
attention O
of O
the O
Baron O
and O
the O
Baroness O
drawn O
to O
herself. O
In O
short, O
to O
any O
one O
in O
her O
position, O
a O
scandal O
would O
be O
most O
detrimental. O
You O
form O
a O
member O
of O
the O
menage O
of O
these O
people; O
wherefore, O
any O
act O
of O
yours O
might O
cause O
such O
a O
scandal--and O
the O
more O
so O
since O
daily O
she O
appears O
in O
public O
arm O
in O
arm O
with O
the O
General O
or O
with O
Mlle. O
Polina. O
NOW O
do O
you O
understand?" O
"No, O
I O
do O
not!" O
I O
shouted O
as O
I O
banged O
my O
fist O
down O
upon O
the O
table--banged O
it O
with O
such O
violence O
that O
a O
frightened O
waiter O
came O
running O
towards O
us. O
"Tell O
me, O
Mr. O
Astley, O
why, O
if O
you O
knew O
this O
history O
all O
along, O
and, O
consequently, O
always O
knew O
who O
this O
Mlle. O
Blanche O
is, O
you O
never O
warned O
either O
myself O
or O
the O
General, O
nor, O
most O
of O
all, O
Mlle. O
Polina" O
(who O
is O
accustomed O
to O
appear O
in O
the O
Casino--in O
public O
everywhere O
with O
Mlle. O
Blanche). O
"How O
could O
you O
do O
it?" O
"It O
would O
have O
done O
no O
good O
to O
warn O
you," O
he O
replied O
quietly, O
"for O
the O
reason O
that O
you O
could O
have O
effected O
nothing. O
Against O
what O
was O
I O
to O
warn O
you? O
As O
likely O
as O
not, O
the O
General O
knows O
more O
about O
Mlle. O
Blanche O
even O
than O
I O
do; O
yet O
the O
unhappy O
man O
still O
walks O
about O
with O
her O
and O
Mlle. O
Polina. O
Only O
yesterday O
I O
saw O
this O
Frenchwoman O
riding, O
splendidly O
mounted, O
with O
De O
Griers, O
while O
the O
General O
was O
careering O
in O
their O
wake O
on O
a O
roan O
horse. O
He O
had O
said, O
that O
morning, O
that O
his O
legs O
were O
hurting O
him, O
yet O
his O
riding-seat O
was O
easy O
enough. O
As O
he O
passed O
I O
looked O
at O
him, O
and O
the O
thought O
occurred O
to O
me O
that O
he O
was O
a O
man O
lost O
for O
ever. O
However, O
it O
is O
no O
affair O
of O
mine, O
for O
I O
have O
only O
recently O
had O
the O
happiness O
to O
make O
Mlle. O
Polina's O
acquaintance. O
Also"--he O
added O
this O
as O
an O
afterthought--"I O
have O
already O
told O
you O
that O
I O
do O
not O
recognise O
your O
right O
to O
ask O
me O
certain O
questions, O
however O
sincere O
be O
my O
liking O
for O
you." O
"Enough," O
I O
said, O
rising. O
"To O
me O
it O
is O
as O
clear O
as O
day O
that O
Mlle. O
Polina PERSON
knows O
all O
about O
this O
Mlle. O
Blanche, O
but O
cannot O
bring O
herself O
to O
part O
with O
her O
Frenchman; O
wherefore, O
she O
consents O
also O
to O
be O
seen O
in O
public O
with O
Mlle. O
Blanche. O
You O
may O
be O
sure O
that O
nothing O
else O
would O
ever O
have O
induced O
her O
either O
to O
walk O
about O
with O
this O
Frenchwoman O
or O
to O
send O
me O
a O
note O
not O
to O
touch O
the O
Baron. O
Yes, O
it O
is O
THERE O
that O
the O
influence O
lies O
before O
which O
everything O
in O
the O
world O
must O
bow! O
Yet O
she O
herself O
it O
was O
who O
launched O
me O
at O
the O
Baron! O
The O
devil O
take O
it, O
but O
I O
was O
left O
no O
choice O
in O
the O
matter." O
"You O
forget, O
in O
the O
first O
place, O
that O
this O
Mlle. O
de O
Cominges O
is O
the O
General's O
inamorata, O
and, O
in O
the O
second O
place, O
that O
Mlle. O
Polina, O
the O
General's O
step-daughter, O
has O
a O
younger O
brother O
and O
sister O
who, O
though O
they O
are O
the O
General's O
own O
children, O
are O
completely O
neglected O
by O
this O
madman, O
and O
robbed O
as O
well." O
"Yes, O
yes; O
that O
is O
so. O
For O
me O
to O
go O
and O
desert O
the O
children O
now O
would O
mean O
their O
total O
abandonment; O
whereas, O
if O
I O
remain, O
I O
should O
be O
able O
to O
defend O
their O
interests, O
and, O
perhaps, O
to O
save O
a O
moiety O
of O
their O
property. O
Yes, O
yes; O
that O
is O
quite O
true. O
And O
yet, O
and O
yet--Oh, O
I O
can O
well O
understand O
why O
they O
are O
all O
so O
interested O
in O
the O
General's O
mother!" O
"In O
whom?" O
asked O
Mr. O
Astley. O
"In O
the O
old O
woman O
of O
Moscow LOCATION
who O
declines O
to O
die, O
yet O
concerning O
whom O
they O
are O
for O
ever O
expecting O
telegrams O
to O
notify O
the O
fact O
of O
her O
death." O
"Ah, O
then O
of O
course O
their O
interests O
centre O
around O
her. O
It O
is O
a O
question O
of O
succession. O
Let O
that O
but O
be O
settled, O
and O
the O
General O
will O
marry, O
Mlle. O
Polina PERSON
will O
be O
set O
free, O
and O
De O
Griers--" O
"Yes, O
and O
De O
Griers?" O
"Will O
be O
repaid O
his O
money, O
which O
is O
what O
he O
is O
now O
waiting O
for." O
"What? O
You O
think O
that O
he O
is O
waiting O
for O
that?" O
"I O
know O
of O
nothing O
else," O
asserted O
Mr. O
Astley PERSON
doggedly. O
"But, O
I O
do, O
I O
do!" O
I O
shouted O
in O
my O
fury. O
"He O
is O
waiting O
also O
for O
the O
old O
woman's O
will, O
for O
the O
reason O
that O
it O
awards O
Mlle. O
Polina PERSON
a O
dowry. O
As O
soon O
as O
ever O
the O
money O
is O
received, O
she O
will O
throw O
herself O
upon O
the O
Frenchman's O
neck. O
All O
women O
are O
like O
that. O
Even O
the O
proudest O
of O
them O
become O
abject O
slaves O
where O
marriage O
is O
concerned. O
What O
Polina PERSON
is O
good O
for O
is O
to O
fall O
head O
over O
ears O
in O
love. O
That O
is O
MY O
opinion. O
Look O
at O
her--especially O
when O
she O
is O
sitting O
alone, O
and O
plunged O
in O
thought. O
All O
this O
was O
pre-ordained O
and O
foretold, O
and O
is O
accursed. O
Polina PERSON
could O
perpetrate O
any O
mad O
act. O
She--she--But O
who O
called O
me O
by O
name?" O
I O
broke O
off. O
"Who O
is O
shouting O
for O
me? O
I O
heard O
some O
one O
calling O
in O
Russian, O
'Alexis O
Ivanovitch!' O
It O
was O
a O
woman's O
voice. O
Listen!" O
At O
the O
moment, O
we O
were O
approaching O
my O
hotel. O
We O
had O
left O
the O
cafe O
long O
ago, O
without O
even O
noticing O
that O
we O
had O
done O
so. O
"Yes, O
I O
DID O
hear O
a O
woman's O
voice O
calling, O
but O
whose O
I O
do O
not O
know. O
The O
someone O
was O
calling O
you O
in O
Russian. O
Ah! O
NOW O
I O
can O
see O
whence O
the O
cries O
come. O
They O
come O
from O
that O
lady O
there--the O
one O
who O
is O
sitting O
on O
the O
settee, O
the O
one O
who O
has O
just O
been O
escorted O
to O
the O
verandah O
by O
a O
crowd O
of O
lacqueys. O
Behind O
her O
see O
that O
pile O
of O
luggage! O
She O
must O
have O
arrived O
by O
train." O
"But O
why O
should O
she O
be O
calling O
ME? O
Hear O
her O
calling O
again! O
See! O
She O
is O
beckoning O
to O
us!" O
"Yes, O
so O
she O
is," O
assented O
Mr. O
Astley. O
"Alexis O
Ivanovitch, O
Alexis PERSON
Ivanovitch! O
Good O
heavens, O
what O
a O
stupid O
fellow!" O
came O
in O
a O
despairing O
wail O
from O
the O
verandah. O
We O
had O
almost O
reached O
the O
portico, O
and O
I O
was O
just O
setting O
foot O
upon O
the O
space O
before O
it, O
when O
my O
hands O
fell O
to O
my O
sides O
in O
limp O
astonishment, O
and O
my O
feet O
glued O
themselves O
to O
the O
pavement! O
IX O
For O
on O
the O
topmost O
tier O
of O
the O
hotel O
verandah, O
after O
being O
carried O
up O
the O
steps O
in O
an O
armchair O
amid O
a O
bevy O
of O
footmen, O
maid-servants, O
and O
other O
menials O
of O
the O
hotel, O
headed O
by O
the O
landlord O
(that O
functionary O
had O
actually O
run O
out O
to O
meet O
a O
visitor O
who O
arrived O
with O
so O
much O
stir O
and O
din, O
attended O
by O
her O
own O
retinue, O
and O
accompanied O
by O
so O
great O
a O
pile O
of O
trunks O
and O
portmanteaux)--on O
the O
topmost O
tier O
of O
the O
verandah, O
I O
say, O
there O
was O
sitting--THE O
GRANDMOTHER! O
Yes, O
it O
was O
she--rich, O
and O
imposing, O
and O
seventy-five O
years O
of O
age--Antonida O
Vassilievna O
Tarassevitcha, O
landowner O
and O
grande O
dame O
of O
Moscow--the O
"La O
Baboulenka" O
who O
had O
caused O
so O
many O
telegrams O
to O
be O
sent O
off O
and O
received--who O
had O
been O
dying, O
yet O
not O
dying--who O
had, O
in O
her O
own O
person, O
descended O
upon O
us O
even O
as O
snow O
might O
fall O
from O
the O
clouds! O
Though O
unable O
to O
walk, O
she O
had O
arrived O
borne O
aloft O
in O
an O
armchair O
(her O
mode O
of O
conveyance O
for O
the O
last O
five O
years), O
as O
brisk, O
aggressive, O
self-satisfied, O
bolt-upright, O
loudly O
imperious, O
and O
generally O
abusive O
as O
ever. O
In O
fact, O
she O
looked O
exactly O
as O
she O
had O
on O
the O
only O
two O
occasions O
when O
I O
had O
seen O
her O
since O
my O
appointment O
to O
the O
General's O
household. O
Naturally O
enough, O
I O
stood O
petrified O
with O
astonishment. O
She O
had O
sighted O
me O
a O
hundred O
paces O
off! O
Even O
while O
she O
was O
being O
carried O
along O
in O
her O
chair O
she O
had O
recognised O
me, O
and O
called O
me O
by O
name O
and O
surname O
(which, O
as O
usual, O
after O
hearing O
once, O
she O
had O
remembered O
ever O
afterwards). O
"And O
this O
is O
the O
woman O
whom O
they O
had O
thought O
to O
see O
in O
her O
grave O
after O
making O
her O
will!" O
I O
thought O
to O
myself. O
"Yet O
she O
will O
outlive O
us, O
and O
every O
one O
else O
in O
the O
hotel. O
Good O
Lord! O
what O
is O
going O
to O
become O
of O
us O
now? O
What O
on O
earth O
is O
to O
happen O
to O
the O
General? O
She O
will O
turn O
the O
place O
upside O
down!" O
"My O
good O
sir," O
the O
old O
woman O
continued O
in O
a O
stentorian O
voice, O
"what O
are O
you O
standing O
THERE O
for, O
with O
your O
eyes O
almost O
falling O
out O
of O
your O
head? O
Cannot O
you O
come O
and O
say O
how-do-you-do? O
Are O
you O
too O
proud O
to O
shake O
hands? O
Or O
do O
you O
not O
recognise O
me? O
Here, O
Potapitch!" O
she O
cried O
to O
an O
old O
servant O
who, O
dressed O
in O
a O
frock O
coat O
and O
white O
waistcoat, O
had O
a O
bald, O
red O
head O
(he O
was O
the O
chamberlain O
who O
always O
accompanied O
her O
on O
her O
journeys). O
"Just O
think! O
Alexis PERSON
Ivanovitch PERSON
does O
not O
recognise O
me! O
They O
have O
buried O
me O
for O
good O
and O
all! O
Yes, O
and O
after O
sending O
hosts O
of O
telegrams O
to O
know O
if O
I O
were O
dead O
or O
not! O
Yes, O
yes, O
I O
have O
heard O
the O
whole O
story. O
I O
am O
very O
much O
alive, O
though, O
as O
you O
may O
see." O
"Pardon O
me, O
Antonida O
Vassilievna," O
I O
replied O
good O
humouredly O
as O
I O
recovered O
my O
presence O
of O
mind. O
"I O
have O
no O
reason O
to O
wish O
you O
ill. O
I O
am O
merely O
rather O
astonished O
to O
see O
you. O
Why O
should O
I O
not O
be O
so, O
seeing O
how O
unexpected--" O
"WHY O
should O
you O
be O
astonished? O
I O
just O
got O
into O
my O
chair, O
and O
came. O
Things O
are O
quiet O
enough O
in O
the O
train, O
for O
there O
is O
no O
one O
there O
to O
chatter. O
Have O
you O
been O
out O
for O
a O
walk?" O
"Yes. O
I O
have O
just O
been O
to O
the O
Casino." O
"Oh? O
Well, O
it O
is O
quite O
nice O
here," O
she O
went O
on O
as O
she O
looked O
about O
her. O
"The O
place O
seems O
comfortable, O
and O
all O
the O
trees O
are O
out. O
I O
like O
it O
very O
well. O
Are O
your O
people O
at O
home? O
Is O
the O
General, O
for O
instance, O
indoors?" O
"Yes; O
and O
probably O
all O
of O
them." O
"Do O
they O
observe O
the O
convenances, O
and O
keep O
up O
appearances? O
Such O
things O
always O
give O
one O
tone. O
I O
have O
heard O
that O
they O
are O
keeping O
a O
carriage, O
even O
as O
Russian O
gentlefolks O
ought O
to O
do. O
When O
abroad, O
our O
Russian O
people O
always O
cut O
a O
dash. O
Is O
Prascovia O
here O
too?" O
"Yes. O
Polina PERSON
Alexandrovna PERSON
is O
here." O
"And O
the O
Frenchwoman? O
However, O
I O
will O
go O
and O
look O
for O
them O
myself. O
Tell O
me O
the O
nearest O
way O
to O
their O
rooms. O
Do O
you O
like O
being O
here?" O
"Yes, O
I O
thank O
you, O
Antonida O
Vassilievna." O
"And O
you, O
Potapitch, O
you O
go O
and O
tell O
that O
fool O
of O
a O
landlord O
to O
reserve O
me O
a O
suitable O
suite O
of O
rooms. O
They O
must O
be O
handsomely O
decorated, O
and O
not O
too O
high O
up. O
Have O
my O
luggage O
taken O
up O
to O
them. O
But O
what O
are O
you O
tumbling O
over O
yourselves O
for? O
Why O
are O
you O
all O
tearing O
about? O
What O
scullions O
these O
fellows O
are!--Who O
is O
that O
with O
you?" O
she O
added O
to O
myself. O
"A O
Mr. O
Astley," O
I O
replied. O
"And O
who O
is O
Mr. O
Astley?" O
"A O
fellow-traveller, O
and O
my O
very O
good O
friend, O
as O
well O
as O
an O
acquaintance O
of O
the O
General's." O
"Oh, O
an O
Englishman? O
Then O
that O
is O
why O
he O
stared O
at O
me O
without O
even O
opening O
his O
lips. O
However, O
I O
like O
Englishmen. O
Now, O
take O
me O
upstairs, O
direct O
to O
their O
rooms. O
Where O
are O
they O
lodging?" O
Madame O
was O
lifted O
up O
in O
her O
chair O
by O
the O
lacqueys, O
and O
I O
preceded O
her O
up O
the O
grand O
staircase. O
Our O
progress O
was O
exceedingly O
effective, O
for O
everyone O
whom O
we O
met O
stopped O
to O
stare O
at O
the O
cortege. O
It O
happened O
that O
the O
hotel O
had O
the O
reputation O
of O
being O
the O
best, O
the O
most O
expensive, O
and O
the O
most O
aristocratic O
in O
all O
the O
spa, O
and O
at O
every O
turn O
on O
the O
staircase O
or O
in O
the O
corridors O
we O
encountered O
fine O
ladies O
and O
important-looking O
Englishmen--more O
than O
one O
of O
whom O
hastened O
downstairs O
to O
inquire O
of O
the O
awestruck O
landlord O
who O
the O
newcomer O
was. O
To O
all O
such O
questions O
he O
returned O
the O
same O
answer--namely, O
that O
the O
old O
lady O
was O
an O
influential O
foreigner, O
a O
Russian, O
a O
Countess, O
and O
a O
grande O
dame, O
and O
that O
she O
had O
taken O
the O
suite O
which, O
during O
the O
previous O
week, O
had O
been O
tenanted O
by O
the O
Grande O
Duchesse O
de O
N. O
Meanwhile O
the O
cause O
of O
the O
sensation--the O
Grandmother--was O
being O
borne O
aloft O
in O
her O
armchair. O
Every O
person O
whom O
she O
met O
she O
scanned O
with O
an O
inquisitive O
eye, O
after O
first O
of O
all O
interrogating O
me O
about O
him O
or O
her O
at O
the O
top O
of O
her O
voice. O
She O
was O
stout O
of O
figure, O
and, O
though O
she O
could O
not O
leave O
her O
chair, O
one O
felt, O
the O
moment O
that O
one O
first O
looked O
at O
her, O
that O
she O
was O
also O
tall O
of O
stature. O
Her O
back O
was O
as O
straight O
as O
a O
board, O
and O
never O
did O
she O
lean O
back O
in O
her O
seat. O
Also, O
her O
large O
grey O
head, O
with O
its O
keen, O
rugged O
features, O
remained O
always O
erect O
as O
she O
glanced O
about O
her O
in O
an O
imperious, O
challenging O
sort O
of O
way, O
with O
looks O
and O
gestures O
that O
clearly O
were O
unstudied. O
Though O
she O
had O
reached O
her O
seventy-sixth O
year, O
her O
face O
was O
still O
fresh, O
and O
her O
teeth O
had O
not O
decayed. O
Lastly, O
she O
was O
dressed O
in O
a O
black O
silk O
gown O
and O
white O
mobcap. O
"She O
interests O
me O
tremendously," O
whispered O
Mr. O
Astley PERSON
as, O
still O
smoking, O
he O
walked O
by O
my O
side. O
Meanwhile O
I O
was O
reflecting O
that O
probably O
the O
old O
lady O
knew O
all O
about O
the O
telegrams, O
and O
even O
about O
De O
Griers, O
though O
little O
or O
nothing O
about O
Mlle. O
Blanche. O
I O
said O
as O
much O
to O
Mr. O
Astley. O
But O
what O
a O
frail O
creature O
is O
man! O
No O
sooner O
was O
my O
first O
surprise O
abated O
than O
I O
found O
myself O
rejoicing O
in O
the O
shock O
which O
we O
were O
about O
to O
administer O
to O
the O
General. O
So O
much O
did O
the O
thought O
inspire O
me O
that O
I O
marched O
ahead O
in O
the O
gayest O
of O
fashions. O
Our O
party O
was O
lodging O
on O
the O
third O
floor. O
Without O
knocking O
at O
the O
door, O
or O
in O
any O
way O
announcing O
our O
presence, O
I O
threw O
open O
the O
portals, O
and O
the O
Grandmother O
was O
borne O
through O
them O
in O
triumph. O
As O
though O
of O
set O
purpose, O
the O
whole O
party O
chanced O
at O
that O
moment O
to O
be O
assembled O
in O
the O
General's O
study. O
The O
time O
was O
eleven O
o'clock, O
and O
it O
seemed O
that O
an O
outing O
of O
some O
sort O
(at O
which O
a O
portion O
of O
the O
party O
were O
to O
drive O
in O
carriages, O
and O
others O
to O
ride O
on O
horseback, O
accompanied O
by O
one O
or O
two O
extraneous O
acquaintances) O
was O
being O
planned. O
The O
General O
was O
present, O
and O
also O
Polina, O
the O
children, O
the O
latter's O
nurses, O
De O
Griers, O
Mlle. O
Blanche O
(attired O
in O
a O
riding-habit), O
her O
mother, O
the O
young O
Prince, O
and O
a O
learned O
German O
whom O
I O
beheld O
for O
the O
first O
time. O
Into O
the O
midst O
of O
this O
assembly O
the O
lacqueys O
conveyed O
Madame O
in O
her O
chair, O
and O
set O
her O
down O
within O
three O
paces O
of O
the O
General! O
Good O
heavens! O
Never O
shall O
I O
forget O
the O
spectacle O
which O
ensued! O
Just O
before O
our O
entry, O
the O
General O
had O
been O
holding O
forth O
to O
the O
company, O
with O
De PERSON
Griers PERSON
in O
support O
of O
him. O
I O
may O
also O
mention O
that, O
for O
the O
last O
two O
or O
three O
days, O
Mlle. O
Blanche O
and O
De PERSON
Griers PERSON
had O
been O
making O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
the O
young O
Prince, O
under O
the O
very O
nose O
of O
the O
poor O
General. O
In O
short, O
the O
company, O
though O
decorous O
and O
conventional, O
was O
in O
a O
gay, O
familiar O
mood. O
But O
no O
sooner O
did O
the O
Grandmother O
appear O
than O
the O
General O
stopped O
dead O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
a O
word, O
and, O
with O
jaw O
dropping, O
stared O
hard O
at O
the O
old O
lady--his O
eyes O
almost O
starting O
out O
of O
his O
head, O
and O
his O
expression O
as O
spellbound O
as O
though O
he O
had O
just O
seen O
a O
basilisk. O
In O
return, O
the O
Grandmother O
stared O
at O
him O
silently O
and O
without O
moving--though O
with O
a O
look O
of O
mingled O
challenge, O
triumph, O
and O
ridicule O
in O
her O
eyes. O
For O
ten O
seconds O
did O
the O
pair O
remain O
thus O
eyeing O
one O
another, O
amid O
the O
profound O
silence O
of O
the O
company; O
and O
even O
De PERSON
Griers PERSON
sat O
petrified--an O
extraordinary O
look O
of O
uneasiness O
dawning O
on O
his O
face. O
As O
for O
Mlle. O
Blanche, O
she O
too O
stared O
wildly O
at O
the O
Grandmother, O
with O
eyebrows O
raised O
and O
her O
lips O
parted--while O
the O
Prince O
and O
the O
German O
savant O
contemplated O
the O
tableau O
in O
profound O
amazement. O
Only O
Polina PERSON
looked O
anything O
but O
perplexed O
or O
surprised. O
Presently, O
however, O
she O
too O
turned O
as O
white O
as O
a O
sheet, O
and O
then O
reddened O
to O
her O
temples. O
Truly O
the O
Grandmother's O
arrival O
seemed O
to O
be O
a O
catastrophe O
for O
everybody! O
For O
my O
own O
part, O
I O
stood O
looking O
from O
the O
Grandmother O
to O
the O
company, O
and O
back O
again, O
while O
Mr. O
Astley, O
as O
usual, O
remained O
in O
the O
background, O
and O
gazed O
calmly O
and O
decorously O
at O
the O
scene. O
"Well, O
here O
I O
am--and O
instead O
of O
a O
telegram, O
too!" O
the O
Grandmother O
at O
last O
ejaculated, O
to O
dissipate O
the O
silence. O
"What? O
You O
were O
not O
expecting O
me?" O
"Antonida O
Vassilievna! O
O O
my O
dearest O
mother! O
But O
how O
on O
earth O
did O
you, O
did O
you--?" O
The O
mutterings O
of O
the O
unhappy O
General O
died O
away. O
I O
verily O
believe O
that O
if O
the O
Grandmother O
had O
held O
her O
tongue O
a O
few O
seconds O
longer O
she O
would O
have O
had O
a O
stroke. O
"How O
on O
earth O
did O
I O
WHAT?" O
she O
exclaimed. O
"Why, O
I O
just O
got O
into O
the O
train O
and O
came O
here. O
What O
else O
is O
the O
railway O
meant O
for? O
But O
you O
thought O
that O
I O
had O
turned O
up O
my O
toes O
and O
left O
my O
property O
to O
the O
lot O
of O
you. O
Oh, O
I O
know O
ALL O
about O
the O
telegrams O
which O
you O
have O
been O
dispatching. O
They O
must O
have O
cost O
you O
a O
pretty O
sum, O
I O
should O
think, O
for O
telegrams O
are O
not O
sent O
from O
abroad O
for O
nothing. O
Well, O
I O
picked O
up O
my O
heels, O
and O
came O
here. O
Who O
is O
this O
Frenchman? O
Monsieur O
de O
Griers, O
I O
suppose?" O
"Oui, O
madame," O
assented O
De O
Griers. O
"Et, O
croyez, O
je O
suis O
si O
enchante! O
Votre O
sante--c'est O
un O
miracle O
vous O
voir O
ici. O
Une O
surprise O
charmante!" O
"Just O
so. O
'Charmante!' O
I O
happen O
to O
know O
you O
as O
a O
mountebank, O
and O
therefore O
trust O
you O
no O
more O
than O
THIS." O
She O
indicated O
her O
little O
finger. O
"And O
who O
is O
THAT?" O
she O
went O
on, O
turning O
towards O
Mlle. O
Blanche. O
Evidently O
the O
Frenchwoman O
looked O
so O
becoming O
in O
her O
riding-habit, O
with O
her O
whip O
in O
her O
hand, O
that O
she O
had O
made O
an O
impression O
upon O
the O
old O
lady. O
"Who O
is O
that O
woman O
there?" O
"Mlle. O
de O
Cominges," O
I O
said. O
"And O
this O
is O
her O
mother, O
Madame O
de O
Cominges. O
They O
also O
are O
staying O
in O
the O
hotel." O
"Is O
the O
daughter O
married?" O
asked O
the O
old O
lady, O
without O
the O
least O
semblance O
of O
ceremony. O
"No," O
I O
replied O
as O
respectfully O
as O
possible, O
but O
under O
my O
breath. O
"Is O
she O
good O
company?" O
I O
failed O
to O
understand O
the O
question. O
"I O
mean, O
is O
she O
or O
is O
she O
not O
a O
bore? O
Can O
she O
speak O
Russian? O
When O
this O
De PERSON
Griers PERSON
was O
in O
Moscow LOCATION
he O
soon O
learnt O
to O
make O
himself O
understood." O
I O
explained O
to O
the O
old O
lady O
that O
Mlle. O
Blanche PERSON
had O
never O
visited O
Russia. O
"Bonjour, O
then," O
said O
Madame, O
with O
sudden O
brusquerie. O
"Bonjour, O
madame," O
replied O
Mlle. O
Blanche PERSON
with O
an O
elegant, O
ceremonious O
bow O
as, O
under O
cover O
of O
an O
unwonted O
modesty, O
she O
endeavoured O
to O
express, O
both O
in O
face O
and O
figure, O
her O
extreme O
surprise O
at O
such O
strange O
behaviour O
on O
the O
part O
of O
the O
Grandmother. O
"How O
the O
woman O
sticks O
out O
her O
eyes O
at O
me! O
How O
she O
mows O
and O
minces!" O
was O
the O
Grandmother's O
comment. O
Then O
she O
turned O
suddenly O
to O
the O
General, O
and O
continued: O
"I O
have O
taken O
up O
my O
abode O
here, O
so O
am O
going O
to O
be O
your O
next-door O
neighbour. O
Are O
you O
glad O
to O
hear O
that, O
or O
are O
you O
not?" O
"My O
dear O
mother, O
believe O
me O
when O
I O
say O
that O
I O
am O
sincerely O
delighted," O
returned O
the O
General, O
who O
had O
now, O
to O
a O
certain O
extent, O
recovered O
his O
senses; O
and O
inasmuch O
as, O
when O
occasion O
arose, O
he O
could O
speak O
with O
fluency, O
gravity, O
and O
a O
certain O
effect, O
he O
set O
himself O
to O
be O
expansive O
in O
his O
remarks, O
and O
went O
on: O
"We O
have O
been O
so O
dismayed O
and O
upset O
by O
the O
news O
of O
your O
indisposition! O
We O
had O
received O
such O
hopeless O
telegrams O
about O
you! O
Then O
suddenly--" O
"Fibs, O
fibs!" O
interrupted O
the O
Grandmother. O
"How O
on O
earth, O
too, O
did O
you O
come O
to O
decide O
upon O
the O
journey?" O
continued O
the O
General, O
with O
raised O
voice O
as O
he O
hurried O
to O
overlook O
the O
old O
lady's O
last O
remark. O
"Surely, O
at O
your O
age, O
and O
in O
your O
present O
state O
of O
health, O
the O
thing O
is O
so O
unexpected O
that O
our O
surprise O
is O
at O
least O
intelligible. O
However, O
I O
am O
glad O
to O
see O
you O
(as O
indeed, O
are O
we O
all"--he O
said O
this O
with O
a O
dignified, O
yet O
conciliatory, O
smile), O
"and O
will O
use O
my O
best O
endeavours O
to O
render O
your O
stay O
here O
as O
pleasant O
as O
possible." O
"Enough! O
All O
this O
is O
empty O
chatter. O
You O
are O
talking O
the O
usual O
nonsense. O
I O
shall O
know O
quite O
well O
how O
to O
spend O
my O
time. O
How O
did O
I O
come O
to O
undertake O
the O
journey, O
you O
ask? O
Well, O
is O
there O
anything O
so O
very O
surprising O
about O
it? O
It O
was O
done O
quite O
simply. O
What O
is O
every O
one O
going O
into O
ecstasies O
about?--How O
do O
you O
do, O
Prascovia? O
What O
are O
YOU O
doing O
here?" O
"And O
how O
are O
YOU, O
Grandmother?" O
replied O
Polina, O
as O
she O
approached O
the O
old O
lady. O
"Were O
you O
long O
on O
the O
journey?" O
"The O
most O
sensible O
question O
that O
I O
have O
yet O
been O
asked! O
Well, O
you O
shall O
hear O
for O
yourself O
how O
it O
all O
happened. O
I O
lay O
and O
lay, O
and O
was O
doctored O
and O
doctored, O
until O
at O
last O
I O
drove O
the O
physicians O
from O
me, O
and O
called O
in O
an O
apothecary O
from O
Nicolai PERSON
who O
had O
cured O
an O
old O
woman O
of O
a O
malady O
similar O
to O
my O
own--cured O
her O
merely O
with O
a O
little O
hayseed. O
Well, O
he O
did O
me O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
good, O
for O
on O
the O
third O
day O
I O
broke O
into O
a O
sweat, O
and O
was O
able O
to O
leave O
my O
bed. O
Then O
my O
German O
doctors O
held O
another O
consultation, O
put O
on O
their O
spectacles, O
and O
told O
me O
that O
if O
I O
would O
go O
abroad, O
and O
take O
a O
course O
of O
the O
waters, O
the O
indisposition O
would O
finally O
pass O
away. O
'Why O
should O
it O
not?' O
I O
thought O
to O
myself. O
So O
I O
had O
got O
things O
ready, O
and O
on O
the O
following O
day, O
a O
Friday, O
set O
out O
for O
here. O
I O
occupied O
a O
special O
compartment O
in O
the O
train, O
and O
where O
ever O
I O
had O
to O
change O
I O
found O
at O
the O
station O
bearers O
who O
were O
ready O
to O
carry O
me O
for O
a O
few O
coppers. O
You O
have O
nice O
quarters O
here," O
she O
went O
on O
as O
she O
glanced O
around O
the O
room. O
"But O
where O
on O
earth O
did O
you O
get O
the O
money O
for O
them, O
my O
good O
sir? O
I O
thought O
that O
everything O
of O
yours O
had O
been O
mortgaged? O
This O
Frenchman O
alone O
must O
be O
your O
creditor O
for O
a O
good O
deal. O
Oh, O
I O
know O
all O
about O
it, O
all O
about O
it." O
"I-I O
am O
surprised O
at O
you, O
my O
dearest O
mother," O
said O
the O
General O
in O
some O
confusion. O
"I-I O
am O
greatly O
surprised. O
But O
I O
do O
not O
need O
any O
extraneous O
control O
of O
my O
finances. O
Moreover, O
my O
expenses O
do O
not O
exceed O
my O
income, O
and O
we--" O
"They O
do O
not O
exceed O
it? O
Fie! O
Why, O
you O
are O
robbing O
your O
children O
of O
their O
last O
kopeck--you, O
their O
guardian!" O
"After O
this," O
said O
the O
General, O
completely O
taken O
aback, O
"--after O
what O
you O
have O
just O
said, O
I O
do O
not O
know O
whether--" O
"You O
do O
not O
know O
what? O
By O
heavens, O
are O
you O
never O
going O
to O
drop O
that O
roulette O
of O
yours? O
Are O
you O
going O
to O
whistle O
all O
your O
property O
away?" O
This O
made O
such O
an O
impression O
upon O
the O
General O
that O
he O
almost O
choked O
with O
fury. O
"Roulette, O
indeed? O
I O
play O
roulette? O
Really, O
in O
view O
of O
my O
position--Recollect O
what O
you O
are O
saying, O
my O
dearest O
mother. O
You O
must O
still O
be O
unwell." O
"Rubbish, O
rubbish!" O
she O
retorted. O
"The O
truth O
is O
that O
you O
CANNOT O
be O
got O
away O
from O
that O
roulette. O
You O
are O
simply O
telling O
lies. O
This O
very O
day O
I O
mean O
to O
go O
and O
see O
for O
myself O
what O
roulette O
is O
like. O
Prascovia, O
tell O
me O
what O
there O
is O
to O
be O
seen O
here; O
and O
do O
you, O
Alexis PERSON
Ivanovitch, O
show O
me O
everything; O
and O
do O
you, O
Potapitch, O
make O
me O
a O
list O
of O
excursions. O
What O
IS O
there O
to O
be O
seen?" O
again O
she O
inquired O
of O
Polina. O
"There O
is O
a O
ruined O
castle, O
and O
the O
Shlangenberg." O
"The O
Shlangenberg? O
What O
is O
it? O
A O
forest?" O
"No, O
a O
mountain O
on O
the O
summit O
of O
which O
there O
is O
a O
place O
fenced O
off. O
From O
it O
you O
can O
get O
a O
most O
beautiful O
view." O
"Could O
a O
chair O
be O
carried O
up O
that O
mountain O
of O
yours?" O
"Doubtless O
we O
could O
find O
bearers O
for O
the O
purpose," O
I O
interposed. O
At O
this O
moment O
Theodosia, O
the O
nursemaid, O
approached O
the O
old O
lady O
with O
the O
General's O
children. O
"No, O
I O
DON'T O
want O
to O
see O
them," O
said O
the O
Grandmother. O
"I O
hate O
kissing O
children, O
for O
their O
noses O
are O
always O
wet. O
How O
are O
you O
getting O
on, O
Theodosia?" O
"I O
am O
very O
well, O
thank O
you, O
Madame," O
replied O
the O
nursemaid. O
"And O
how O
is O
your O
ladyship? O
We O
have O
been O
feeling O
so O
anxious O
about O
you!" O
"Yes, O
I O
know, O
you O
simple O
soul--But O
who O
are O
those O
other O
guests?" O
the O
old O
lady O
continued, O
turning O
again O
to O
Polina. O
"For O
instance, O
who O
is O
that O
old O
rascal O
in O
the O
spectacles?" O
"Prince O
Nilski, O
Grandmamma," O
whispered O
Polina. O
"Oh, O
a O
Russian? O
Why, O
I O
had O
no O
idea O
that O
he O
could O
understand O
me! O
Surely O
he O
did O
not O
hear O
what O
I O
said? O
As O
for O
Mr. O
Astley, O
I O
have O
seen O
him O
already, O
and O
I O
see O
that O
he O
is O
here O
again. O
How O
do O
you O
do?" O
she O
added O
to O
the O
gentleman O
in O
question. O
Mr. O
Astley PERSON
bowed O
in O
silence. O
"Have O
you O
NOTHING O
to O
say O
to O
me?" O
the O
old O
lady O
went O
on. O
"Say O
something, O
for O
goodness' O
sake! O
Translate O
to O
him, O
Polina." O
Polina PERSON
did O
so. O
"I O
have O
only O
to O
say," O
replied O
Mr. O
Astley PERSON
gravely, O
but O
also O
with O
alacrity, O
"that O
I O
am O
indeed O
glad O
to O
see O
you O
in O
such O
good O
health." O
This O
was O
interpreted O
to O
the O
Grandmother, O
and O
she O
seemed O
much O
gratified. O
"How O
well O
English O
people O
know O
how O
to O
answer O
one!" O
she O
remarked. O
"That O
is O
why O
I O
like O
them O
so O
much O
better O
than O
French. O
Come O
here," O
she O
added O
to O
Mr. O
Astley. O
"I O
will O
try O
not O
to O
bore O
you O
too O
much. O
Polina, O
translate O
to O
him O
that O
I O
am O
staying O
in O
rooms O
on O
a O
lower O
floor. O
Yes, O
on O
a O
lower O
floor," O
she O
repeated O
to O
Astley, O
pointing O
downwards O
with O
her O
finger. O
Astley PERSON
looked O
pleased O
at O
receiving O
the O
invitation. O
Next, O
the O
old O
lady O
scanned O
Polina, O
from O
head O
to O
foot O
with O
minute O
attention. O
"I O
could O
almost O
have O
liked O
you, O
Prascovia," O
suddenly O
she O
remarked, O
"for O
you O
are O
a O
nice O
girl--the O
best O
of O
the O
lot. O
You O
have O
some O
character O
about O
you. O
I O
too O
have O
character. O
Turn O
round. O
Surely O
that O
is O
not O
false O
hair O
that O
you O
are O
wearing?" O
"No, O
Grandmamma. O
It O
is O
my O
own." O
"Well, O
well. O
I O
do O
not O
like O
the O
stupid O
fashions O
of O
today. O
You O
are O
very O
good O
looking. O
I O
should O
have O
fallen O
in O
love O
with O
you O
if O
I O
had O
been O
a O
man. O
Why O
do O
you O
not O
get O
married? O
It O
is O
time O
now O
that O
I O
was O
going. O
I O
want O
to O
walk, O
yet O
I O
always O
have O
to O
ride. O
Are O
you O
still O
in O
a O
bad O
temper?" O
she O
added O
to O
the O
General. O
"No, O
indeed," O
rejoined O
the O
now O
mollified O
General. O
"I O
quite O
understand O
that O
at O
your O
time O
of O
life--" O
"Cette O
vieille O
est O
tombee O
en O
enfance," O
De PERSON
Griers PERSON
whispered O
to O
me. O
"But O
I O
want O
to O
look O
round O
a O
little," O
the O
old O
lady O
added O
to O
the O
General. O
Will O
you O
lend O
me O
Alexis PERSON
Ivanovitch PERSON
for O
the O
purpose? O
"As O
much O
as O
you O
like. O
But O
I O
myself--yes, O
and O
Polina PERSON
and O
Monsieur PERSON
de PERSON
Griers PERSON
too--we O
all O
of O
us O
hope O
to O
have O
the O
pleasure O
of O
escorting O
you." O
"Mais, O
madame, O
cela O
sera O
un O
plaisir," O
De PERSON
Griers PERSON
commented O
with O
a O
bewitching O
smile. O
"'Plaisir' O
indeed! O
Why, O
I O
look O
upon O
you O
as O
a O
perfect O
fool, O
monsieur." O
Then O
she O
remarked O
to O
the O
General: O
"I O
am O
not O
going O
to O
let O
you O
have O
any O
of O
my O
money. O
I O
must O
be O
off O
to O
my O
rooms O
now, O
to O
see O
what O
they O
are O
like. O
Afterwards O
we O
will O
look O
round O
a O
little. O
Lift O
me O
up." O
Again O
the O
Grandmother O
was O
borne O
aloft O
and O
carried O
down O
the O
staircase O
amid O
a O
perfect O
bevy O
of O
followers--the O
General O
walking O
as O
though O
he O
had O
been O
hit O
over O
the O
head O
with O
a O
cudgel, O
and O
De PERSON
Griers PERSON
seeming O
to O
be O
plunged O
in O
thought. O
Endeavouring O
to O
be O
left O
behind, O
Mlle. O
Blanche O
next O
thought O
better O
of O
it, O
and O
followed O
the O
rest, O
with O
the O
Prince O
in O
her O
wake. O
Only O
the O
German O
savant O
and O
Madame PERSON
de PERSON
Cominges PERSON
did O
not O
leave O
the O
General's O
apartments. O
X O
At O
spas--and, O
probably, O
all O
over O
Europe--hotel O
landlords O
and O
managers O
are O
guided O
in O
their O
allotment O
of O
rooms O
to O
visitors, O
not O
so O
much O
by O
the O
wishes O
and O
requirements O
of O
those O
visitors, O
as O
by O
their O
personal O
estimate O
of O
the O
same. O
It O
may O
also O
be O
said O
that O
these O
landlords O
and O
managers O
seldom O
make O
a O
mistake. O
To O
the O
Grandmother, O
however, O
our O
landlord, O
for O
some O
reason O
or O
another, O
allotted O
such O
a O
sumptuous O
suite O
that O
he O
fairly O
overreached O
himself; O
for O
he O
assigned O
her O
a O
suite O
consisting O
of O
four O
magnificently O
appointed O
rooms, O
with O
bathroom, O
servants' O
quarters, O
a O
separate O
room O
for O
her O
maid, O
and O
so O
on. O
In O
fact, O
during O
the O
previous O
week O
the O
suite O
had O
been O
occupied O
by O
no O
less O
a O
personage O
than O
a O
Grand O
Duchess: O
which O
circumstance O
was O
duly O
explained O
to O
the O
new O
occupant, O
as O
an O
excuse O
for O
raising O
the O
price O
of O
these O
apartments. O
The O
Grandmother O
had O
herself O
carried--or, O
rather, O
wheeled--through O
each O
room O
in O
turn, O
in O
order O
that O
she O
might O
subject O
the O
whole O
to O
a O
close O
and O
attentive O
scrutiny; O
while O
the O
landlord--an O
elderly, O
bald-headed O
man--walked O
respectfully O
by O
her O
side. O
What O
every O
one O
took O
the O
Grandmother O
to O
be O
I O
do O
not O
know, O
but O
it O
appeared, O
at O
least, O
that O
she O
was O
accounted O
a O
person O
not O
only O
of O
great O
importance, O
but O
also, O
and O
still O
more, O
of O
great O
wealth; O
and O
without O
delay O
they O
entered O
her O
in O
the O
hotel O
register O
as O
"Madame O
la O
Generale, O
Princesse O
de O
Tarassevitcheva," O
although O
she O
had O
never O
been O
a O
princess O
in O
her O
life. O
Her O
retinue, O
her O
reserved O
compartment O
in O
the O
train, O
her O
pile O
of O
unnecessary O
trunks, O
portmanteaux, O
and O
strong-boxes, O
all O
helped O
to O
increase O
her O
prestige; O
while O
her O
wheeled O
chair, O
her O
sharp O
tone O
and O
voice, O
her O
eccentric O
questions O
(put O
with O
an O
air O
of O
the O
most O
overbearing O
and O
unbridled O
imperiousness), O
her O
whole O
figure--upright, O
rugged, O
and O
commanding O
as O
it O
was--completed O
the O
general O
awe O
in O
which O
she O
was O
held. O
As O
she O
inspected O
her O
new O
abode O
she O
ordered O
her O
chair O
to O
be O
stopped O
at O
intervals O
in O
order O
that, O
with O
finger O
extended O
towards O
some O
article O
of O
furniture, O
she O
might O
ply O
the O
respectfully O
smiling, O
yet O
secretly O
apprehensive, O
landlord O
with O
unexpected O
questions. O
She O
addressed O
them O
to O
him O
in O
French, O
although O
her O
pronunciation O
of O
the O
language O
was O
so O
bad O
that O
sometimes O
I O
had O
to O
translate O
them. O
For O
the O
most O
part, O
the O
landlord's O
answers O
were O
unsatisfactory, O
and O
failed O
to O
please O
her; O
nor O
were O
the O
questions O
themselves O
of O
a O
practical O
nature, O
but O
related, O
generally, O
to O
God O
knows O
what. O
For O
instance, O
on O
one O
occasion O
she O
halted O
before O
a O
picture O
which, O
a O
poor O
copy O
of O
a O
well-known O
original, O
had O
a O
mythological O
subject. O
"Of O
whom O
is O
this O
a O
portrait?" O
she O
inquired. O
The O
landlord O
explained O
that O
it O
was O
probably O
that O
of O
a O
countess. O
"But O
how O
know O
you O
that?" O
the O
old O
lady O
retorted. O
"You O
live O
here, O
yet O
you O
cannot O
say O
for O
certain! O
And O
why O
is O
the O
picture O
there O
at O
all? O
And O
why O
do O
its O
eyes O
look O
so O
crooked?" O
To O
all O
these O
questions O
the O
landlord O
could O
return O
no O
satisfactory O
reply, O
despite O
his O
floundering O
endeavours. O
"The O
blockhead!" O
exclaimed O
the O
Grandmother O
in O
Russian. O
Then O
she O
proceeded O
on O
her O
way--only O
to O
repeat O
the O
same O
story O
in O
front O
of O
a O
Saxon LOCATION
statuette O
which O
she O
had O
sighted O
from O
afar, O
and O
had O
commanded, O
for O
some O
reason O
or O
another, O
to O
be O
brought O
to O
her. O
Finally, O
she O
inquired O
of O
the O
landlord O
what O
was O
the O
value O
of O
the O
carpet O
in O
her O
bedroom, O
as O
well O
as O
where O
the O
said O
carpet O
had O
been O
manufactured; O
but, O
the O
landlord O
could O
do O
no O
more O
than O
promise O
to O
make O
inquiries. O
"What O
donkeys O
these O
people O
are!" O
she O
commented. O
Next, O
she O
turned O
her O
attention O
to O
the O
bed. O
"What O
a O
huge O
counterpane!" O
she O
exclaimed. O
"Turn O
it O
back, O
please." O
The O
lacqueys O
did O
so. O
"Further O
yet, O
further O
yet," O
the O
old O
lady O
cried. O
"Turn O
it O
RIGHT O
back. O
Also, O
take O
off O
those O
pillows O
and O
bolsters, O
and O
lift O
up O
the O
feather O
bed." O
The O
bed O
was O
opened O
for O
her O
inspection. O
"Mercifully O
it O
contains O
no O
bugs," O
she O
remarked. O
"Pull O
off O
the O
whole O
thing, O
and O
then O
put O
on O
my O
own O
pillows O
and O
sheets. O
The O
place O
is O
too O
luxurious O
for O
an O
old O
woman O
like O
myself. O
It O
is O
too O
large O
for O
any O
one O
person. O
Alexis O
Ivanovitch, O
come O
and O
see O
me O
whenever O
you O
are O
not O
teaching O
your O
pupils." O
"After O
tomorrow O
I O
shall O
no O
longer O
be O
in O
the O
General's O
service," O
I O
replied, O
"but O
merely O
living O
in O
the O
hotel O
on O
my O
own O
account." O
"Why O
so?" O
"Because, O
the O
other O
day, O
there O
arrived O
from O
Berlin LOCATION
a O
German O
and O
his O
wife--persons O
of O
some O
importance; O
and, O
it O
chanced O
that, O
when O
taking O
a O
walk, O
I O
spoke O
to O
them O
in O
German O
without O
having O
properly O
compassed O
the O
Berlin LOCATION
accent." O
"Indeed?" O
"Yes: O
and O
this O
action O
on O
my O
part O
the O
Baron O
held O
to O
be O
an O
insult, O
and O
complained O
about O
it O
to O
the O
General, O
who O
yesterday O
dismissed O
me O
from O
his O
employ." O
"But O
I O
suppose O
you O
must O
have O
threatened O
that O
precious O
Baron, O
or O
something O
of O
the O
kind? O
However, O
even O
if O
you O
did O
so, O
it O
was O
a O
matter O
of O
no O
moment." O
"No, O
I O
did O
not. O
The O
Baron O
was O
the O
aggressor O
by O
raising O
his O
stick O
at O
me." O
Upon O
that O
the O
Grandmother O
turned O
sharply O
to O
the O
General. O
"What? O
You O
permitted O
yourself O
to O
treat O
your O
tutor O
thus, O
you O
nincompoop, O
and O
to O
dismiss O
him O
from O
his O
post? O
You O
are O
a O
blockhead--an O
utter O
blockhead! O
I O
can O
see O
that O
clearly." O
"Do O
not O
alarm O
yourself, O
my O
dear O
mother," O
the O
General O
replied O
with O
a O
lofty O
air--an O
air O
in O
which O
there O
was O
also O
a O
tinge O
of O
familiarity. O
"I O
am O
quite O
capable O
of O
managing O
my O
own O
affairs. O
Moreover, O
Alexis PERSON
Ivanovitch PERSON
has O
not O
given O
you O
a O
true O
account O
of O
the O
matter." O
"What O
did O
you O
do O
next?" O
The O
old O
lady O
inquired O
of O
me. O
"I O
wanted O
to O
challenge O
the O
Baron O
to O
a O
duel," O
I O
replied O
as O
modestly O
as O
possible; O
"but O
the O
General O
protested O
against O
my O
doing O
so." O
"And O
WHY O
did O
you O
so O
protest?" O
she O
inquired O
of O
the O
General. O
Then O
she O
turned O
to O
the O
landlord, O
and O
questioned O
him O
as O
to O
whether O
HE O
would O
not O
have O
fought O
a O
duel, O
if O
challenged. O
"For," O
she O
added, O
"I O
can O
see O
no O
difference O
between O
you O
and O
the O
Baron; O
nor O
can O
I O
bear O
that O
German O
visage O
of O
yours." O
Upon O
this O
the O
landlord O
bowed O
and O
departed, O
though O
he O
could O
not O
have O
understood O
the O
Grandmother's O
compliment. O
"Pardon O
me, O
Madame," O
the O
General O
continued O
with O
a O
sneer, O
"but O
are O
duels O
really O
feasible?" O
"Why O
not? O
All O
men O
are O
crowing O
cocks, O
and O
that O
is O
why O
they O
quarrel. O
YOU, O
though, O
I O
perceive, O
are O
a O
blockhead--a O
man O
who O
does O
not O
even O
know O
how O
to O
carry O
his O
breeding. O
Lift O
me O
up. O
Potapitch, O
see O
to O
it O
that O
you O
always O
have O
TWO O
bearers O
ready. O
Go O
and O
arrange O
for O
their O
hire. O
But O
we O
shall O
not O
require O
more O
than O
two, O
for O
I O
shall O
need O
only O
to O
be O
carried O
upstairs. O
On O
the O
level O
or O
in O
the O
street O
I O
can O
be O
WHEELED O
along. O
Go O
and O
tell O
them O
that, O
and O
pay O
them O
in O
advance, O
so O
that O
they O
may O
show O
me O
some O
respect. O
You O
too, O
Potapitch, O
are O
always O
to O
come O
with O
me, O
and O
YOU, O
Alexis PERSON
Ivanovitch, O
are O
to O
point O
out O
to O
me O
this O
Baron PERSON
as O
we O
go O
along, O
in O
order O
that O
I O
may O
get O
a O
squint O
at O
the O
precious O
'Von.' O
And O
where O
is O
that O
roulette O
played?" O
I O
explained O
to O
her O
that O
the O
game O
was O
carried O
on O
in O
the O
salons O
of O
the O
Casino; O
whereupon O
there O
ensued O
a O
string O
of O
questions O
as O
to O
whether O
there O
were O
many O
such O
salons, O
whether O
many O
people O
played O
in O
them, O
whether O
those O
people O
played O
a O
whole O
day O
at O
a O
time, O
and O
whether O
the O
game O
was O
managed O
according O
to O
fixed O
rules. O
At O
length, O
I O
thought O
it O
best O
to O
say O
that O
the O
most O
advisable O
course O
would O
be O
for O
her O
to O
go O
and O
see O
it O
for O
herself, O
since O
a O
mere O
description O
of O
it O
would O
be O
a O
difficult O
matter. O
"Then O
take O
me O
straight O
there," O
she O
said, O
"and O
do O
you O
walk O
on O
in O
front O
of O
me, O
Alexis PERSON
Ivanovitch." O
"What, O
mother? O
Before O
you O
have O
so O
much O
as O
rested O
from O
your O
journey?" O
the O
General O
inquired O
with O
some O
solicitude. O
Also, O
for O
some O
reason O
which O
I O
could O
not O
divine, O
he O
seemed O
to O
be O
growing O
nervous; O
and, O
indeed, O
the O
whole O
party O
was O
evincing O
signs O
of O
confusion, O
and O
exchanging O
glances O
with O
one O
another. O
Probably O
they O
were O
thinking O
that O
it O
would O
be O
a O
ticklish--even O
an O
embarrassing--business O
to O
accompany O
the O
Grandmother O
to O
the O
Casino, O
where, O
very O
likely, O
she O
would O
perpetrate O
further O
eccentricities, O
and O
in O
public O
too! O
Yet O
on O
their O
own O
initiative O
they O
had O
offered O
to O
escort O
her! O
"Why O
should O
I O
rest?" O
she O
retorted. O
"I O
am O
not O
tired, O
for O
I O
have O
been O
sitting O
still O
these O
past O
five O
days. O
Let O
us O
see O
what O
your O
medicinal O
springs O
and O
waters O
are O
like, O
and O
where O
they O
are O
situated. O
What, O
too, O
about O
that, O
that--what O
did O
you O
call O
it, O
Prascovia?--oh, O
about O
that O
mountain O
top?" O
"Yes, O
we O
are O
going O
to O
see O
it, O
Grandmamma." O
"Very O
well. O
Is O
there O
anything O
else O
for O
me O
to O
see O
here?" O
"Yes! O
Quite O
a O
number O
of O
things," O
Polina PERSON
forced O
herself O
to O
say. O
"Martha, O
YOU O
must O
come O
with O
me O
as O
well," O
went O
on O
the O
old O
lady O
to O
her O
maid. O
"No, O
no, O
mother!" O
ejaculated O
the O
General. O
"Really O
she O
cannot O
come. O
They O
would O
not O
admit O
even O
Potapitch PERSON
to O
the O
Casino." O
"Rubbish! O
Because O
she O
is O
my O
servant, O
is O
that O
a O
reason O
for O
turning O
her O
out? O
Why, O
she O
is O
only O
a O
human O
being O
like O
the O
rest O
of O
us; O
and O
as O
she O
has O
been O
travelling O
for O
a O
week O
she O
might O
like O
to O
look O
about O
her. O
With O
whom O
else O
could O
she O
go O
out O
but O
myself? O
She O
would O
never O
dare O
to O
show O
her O
nose O
in O
the O
street O
alone." O
"But, O
mother--" O
"Are O
you O
ashamed O
to O
be O
seen O
with O
me? O
Stop O
at O
home, O
then, O
and O
you O
will O
be O
asked O
no O
questions. O
A O
pretty O
General O
YOU O
are, O
to O
be O
sure! O
I O
am O
a O
general's O
widow O
myself. O
But, O
after O
all, O
why O
should O
I O
drag O
the O
whole O
party O
with O
me? O
I O
will O
go O
and O
see O
the O
sights O
with O
only O
Alexis PERSON
Ivanovitch PERSON
as O
my O
escort." O
De PERSON
Griers PERSON
strongly O
insisted O
that O
EVERY O
ONE O
ought O
to O
accompany O
her. O
Indeed, O
he O
launched O
out O
into O
a O
perfect O
shower O
of O
charming O
phrases O
concerning O
the O
pleasure O
of O
acting O
as O
her O
cicerone, O
and O
so O
forth. O
Every O
one O
was O
touched O
with O
his O
words. O
"Mais O
elle O
est O
tombee O
en O
enfance," O
he O
added O
aside O
to O
the O
General. O
"Seule, O
elle O
fera O
des O
betises." O
More O
than O
this O
I O
could O
not O
overhear, O
but O
he O
seemed O
to O
have O
got O
some O
plan O
in O
his O
mind, O
or O
even O
to O
be O
feeling O
a O
slight O
return O
of O
his O
hopes. O
The O
distance O
to O
the O
Casino O
was O
about O
half O
a O
verst, O
and O
our O
route O
led O
us O
through O
the O
Chestnut O
Avenue O
until O
we O
reached O
the O
square O
directly O
fronting O
the O
building. O
The O
General, O
I O
could O
see, O
was O
a O
trifle O
reassured O
by O
the O
fact O
that, O
though O
our O
progress O
was O
distinctly O
eccentric O
in O
its O
nature, O
it O
was, O
at O
least, O
correct O
and O
orderly. O
As O
a O
matter O
of O
fact, O
the O
spectacle O
of O
a O
person O
who O
is O
unable O
to O
walk O
is O
not O
anything O
to O
excite O
surprise O
at O
a O
spa. O
Yet O
it O
was O
clear O
that O
the O
General O
had O
a O
great O
fear O
of O
the O
Casino O
itself: O
for O
why O
should O
a O
person O
who O
had O
lost O
the O
use O
of O
her O
limbs--more O
especially O
an O
old O
woman--be O
going O
to O
rooms O
which O
were O
set O
apart O
only O
for O
roulette? O
On O
either O
side O
of O
the O
wheeled O
chair O
walked O
Polina PERSON
and O
Mlle. O
Blanche--the O
latter O
smiling, O
modestly O
jesting, O
and, O
in O
short, O
making O
herself O
so O
agreeable O
to O
the O
Grandmother O
that O
in O
the O
end O
the O
old O
lady O
relented O
towards O
her. O
On O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
chair O
Polina PERSON
had O
to O
answer O
an O
endless O
flow O
of O
petty O
questions--such O
as O
"Who O
was O
it O
passed O
just O
now?" O
"Who O
is O
that O
coming O
along?" O
"Is O
the O
town O
a O
large O
one?" O
"Are O
the O
public O
gardens O
extensive?" O
"What O
sort O
of O
trees O
are O
those?" O
"What O
is O
the O
name O
of O
those O
hills?" O
"Do O
I O
see O
eagles O
flying O
yonder?" O
"What O
is O
that O
absurd-looking O
building?" O
and O
so O
forth. O
Meanwhile O
Astley PERSON
whispered O
to O
me, O
as O
he O
walked O
by O
my O
side, O
that O
he O
looked O
for O
much O
to O
happen O
that O
morning. O
Behind O
the O
old O
lady's O
chair O
marched O
Potapitch PERSON
and O
Martha--Potapitch PERSON
in O
his O
frockcoat O
and O
white O
waistcoat, O
with O
a O
cloak O
over O
all, O
and O
the O
forty-year-old O
and O
rosy, O
but O
slightly O
grey-headed, O
Martha PERSON
in O
a O
mobcap, O
cotton O
dress, O
and O
squeaking O
shoes. O
Frequently O
the O
old O
lady O
would O
twist O
herself O
round O
to O
converse O
with O
these O
servants. O
As O
for O
De O
Griers, O
he O
spoke O
as O
though O
he O
had O
made O
up O
his O
mind O
to O
do O
something O
(though O
it O
is O
also O
possible O
that O
he O
spoke O
in O
this O
manner O
merely O
in O
order O
to O
hearten O
the O
General, O
with O
whom O
he O
appeared O
to O
have O
held O
a O
conference). O
But, O
alas, O
the O
Grandmother O
had O
uttered O
the O
fatal O
words, O
"I O
am O
not O
going O
to O
give O
you O
any O
of O
my O
money;" O
and O
though O
De PERSON
Griers PERSON
might O
regard O
these O
words O
lightly, O
the O
General O
knew O
his O
mother O
better. O
Also, O
I O
noticed O
that O
De PERSON
Griers PERSON
and O
Mlle. O
Blanche O
were O
still O
exchanging O
looks; O
while O
of O
the O
Prince O
and O
the O
German O
savant O
I O
lost O
sight O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
Avenue, O
where O
they O
had O
turned O
back O
and O
left O
us. O
Into O
the O
Casino O
we O
marched O
in O
triumph. O
At O
once, O
both O
in O
the O
person O
of O
the O
commissionaire O
and O
in O
the O
persons O
of O
the O
footmen, O
there O
sprang O
to O
life O
the O
same O
reverence O
as O
had O
arisen O
in O
the O
lacqueys O
of O
the O
hotel. O
Yet O
it O
was O
not O
without O
some O
curiosity O
that O
they O
eyed O
us. O
Without O
loss O
of O
time, O
the O
Grandmother O
gave O
orders O
that O
she O
should O
be O
wheeled O
through O
every O
room O
in O
the O
establishment; O
of O
which O
apartments O
she O
praised O
a O
few, O
while O
to O
others O
she O
remained O
indifferent. O
Concerning O
everything, O
however, O
she O
asked O
questions. O
Finally O
we O
reached O
the O
gaming-salons, O
where O
a O
lacquey O
who O
was, O
acting O
as O
guard O
over O
the O
doors, O
flung O
them O
open O
as O
though O
he O
were O
a O
man O
possessed. O
The O
Grandmother's O
entry O
into O
the O
roulette-salon O
produced O
a O
profound O
impression O
upon O
the O
public. O
Around O
the O
tables, O
and O
at O
the O
further O
end O
of O
the O
room O
where O
the O
trente-et-quarante O
table O
was O
set O
out, O
there O
may O
have O
been O
gathered O
from O
150 O
to O
200 O
gamblers, O
ranged O
in O
several O
rows. O
Those O
who O
had O
succeeded O
in O
pushing O
their O
way O
to O
the O
tables O
were O
standing O
with O
their O
feet O
firmly O
planted, O
in O
order O
to O
avoid O
having O
to O
give O
up O
their O
places O
until O
they O
should O
have O
finished O
their O
game O
(since O
merely O
to O
stand O
looking O
on--thus O
occupying O
a O
gambler's O
place O
for O
nothing--was O
not O
permitted). O
True, O
chairs O
were O
provided O
around O
the O
tables, O
but O
few O
players O
made O
use O
of O
them--more O
especially O
if O
there O
was O
a O
large O
attendance O
of O
the O
general O
public; O
since O
to O
stand O
allowed O
of O
a O
closer O
approach; O
and, O
therefore, O
of O
greater O
facilities O
for O
calculation O
and O
staking. O
Behind O
the O
foremost O
row O
were O
herded O
a O
second O
and O
a O
third O
row O
of O
people O
awaiting O
their O
turn; O
but O
sometimes O
their O
impatience O
led O
these O
people O
to O
stretch O
a O
hand O
through O
the O
first O
row, O
in O
order O
to O
deposit O
their O
stakes. O
Even O
third-row O
individuals O
would O
dart O
forward O
to O
stake; O
whence O
seldom O
did O
more O
than O
five O
or O
ten O
minutes O
pass O
without O
a O
scene O
over O
disputed O
money O
arising O
at O
one O
or O
another O
end O
of O
the O
table. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
the O
police O
of O
the O
Casino O
were O
an O
able O
body O
of O
men; O
and O
though O
to O
escape O
the O
crush O
was O
an O
impossibility, O
however O
much O
one O
might O
wish O
it, O
the O
eight O
croupiers O
apportioned O
to O
each O
table O
kept O
an O
eye O
upon O
the O
stakes, O
performed O
the O
necessary O
reckoning, O
and O
decided O
disputes O
as O
they O
arose. O
In O
the O
last O
resort O
they O
always O
called O
in O
the O
Casino O
police, O
and O
the O
disputes O
would O
immediately O
come O
to O
an O
end. O
Policemen O
were O
stationed O
about O
the O
Casino O
in O
ordinary O
costume, O
and O
mingled O
with O
the O
spectators O
so O
as O
to O
make O
it O
impossible O
to O
recognise O
them. O
In O
particular O
they O
kept O
a O
lookout O
for O
pickpockets O
and O
swindlers, O
who O
simply O
swanned O
in O
the O
roulette O
salons, O
and O
reaped O
a O
rich O
harvest. O
Indeed, O
in O
every O
direction O
money O
was O
being O
filched O
from O
pockets O
or O
purses--though, O
of O
course, O
if O
the O
attempt O
miscarried, O
a O
great O
uproar O
ensued. O
One O
had O
only O
to O
approach O
a O
roulette O
table, O
begin O
to O
play, O
and O
then O
openly O
grab O
some O
one O
else's O
winnings, O
for O
a O
din O
to O
be O
raised, O
and O
the O
thief O
to O
start O
vociferating O
that O
the O
stake O
was O
HIS; O
and, O
if O
the O
coup O
had O
been O
carried O
out O
with O
sufficient O
skill, O
and O
the O
witnesses O
wavered O
at O
all O
in O
their O
testimony, O
the O
thief O
would O
as O
likely O
as O
not O
succeed O
in O
getting O
away O
with O
the O
money, O
provided O
that O
the O
sum O
was O
not O
a O
large O
one--not O
large O
enough O
to O
have O
attracted O
the O
attention O
of O
the O
croupiers O
or O
some O
fellow-player. O
Moreover, O
if O
it O
were O
a O
stake O
of O
insignificant O
size, O
its O
true O
owner O
would O
sometimes O
decline O
to O
continue O
the O
dispute, O
rather O
than O
become O
involved O
in O
a O
scandal. O
Conversely, O
if O
the O
thief O
was O
detected, O
he O
was O
ignominiously O
expelled O
the O
building. O
Upon O
all O
this O
the O
Grandmother O
gazed O
with O
open-eyed O
curiosity; O
and, O
on O
some O
thieves O
happening O
to O
be O
turned O
out O
of O
the O
place, O
she O
was O
delighted. O
Trente-et-quarante O
interested O
her O
but O
little; O
she O
preferred O
roulette, O
with O
its O
ever-revolving O
wheel. O
At O
length O
she O
expressed O
a O
wish O
to O
view O
the O
game O
closer; O
whereupon O
in O
some O
mysterious O
manner, O
the O
lacqueys O
and O
other O
officious O
agents O
(especially O
one O
or O
two O
ruined O
Poles O
of O
the O
kind O
who O
keep O
offering O
their O
services O
to O
successful O
gamblers O
and O
foreigners O
in O
general) O
at O
once O
found O
and O
cleared O
a O
space O
for O
the O
old O
lady O
among O
the O
crush, O
at O
the O
very O
centre O
of O
one O
of O
the O
tables, O
and O
next O
to O
the O
chief O
croupier; O
after O
which O
they O
wheeled O
her O
chair O
thither. O
Upon O
this O
a O
number O
of O
visitors O
who O
were O
not O
playing, O
but O
only O
looking O
on O
(particularly O
some O
Englishmen O
with O
their O
families), O
pressed O
closer O
forward O
towards O
the O
table, O
in O
order O
to O
watch O
the O
old O
lady O
from O
among O
the O
ranks O
of O
the O
gamblers. O
Many O
a O
lorgnette O
I O
saw O
turned O
in O
her O
direction, O
and O
the O
croupiers' O
hopes O
rose O
high O
that O
such O
an O
eccentric O
player O
was O
about O
to O
provide O
them O
with O
something O
out O
of O
the O
common. O
An O
old O
lady O
of O
seventy-five O
years O
who, O
though O
unable O
to O
walk, O
desired O
to O
play O
was O
not O
an O
everyday O
phenomenon. O
I O
too O
pressed O
forward O
towards O
the O
table, O
and O
ranged O
myself O
by O
the O
Grandmother's O
side; O
while O
Martha PERSON
and O
Potapitch PERSON
remained O
somewhere O
in O
the O
background O
among O
the O
crowd, O
and O
the O
General, O
Polina, O
and O
De O
Griers, O
with O
Mlle. O
Blanche, O
also O
remained O
hidden O
among O
the O
spectators. O
At O
first O
the O
old O
lady O
did O
no O
more O
than O
watch O
the O
gamblers, O
and O
ply O
me, O
in O
a O
half-whisper, O
with O
sharp-broken O
questions O
as O
to O
who O
was O
so-and-so. O
Especially O
did O
her O
favour O
light O
upon O
a O
very O
young O
man O
who O
was O
plunging O
heavily, O
and O
had O
won O
(so O
it O
was O
whispered) O
as O
much O
as O
40,000 O
francs, O
which O
were O
lying O
before O
him O
on O
the O
table O
in O
a O
heap O
of O
gold O
and O
bank-notes. O
His O
eyes O
kept O
flashing, O
and O
his O
hands O
shaking; O
yet O
all O
the O
while O
he O
staked O
without O
any O
sort O
of O
calculation--just O
what O
came O
to O
his O
hand, O
as O
he O
kept O
winning O
and O
winning, O
and O
raking O
and O
raking O
in O
his O
gains. O
Around O
him O
lacqueys O
fussed--placing O
chairs O
just O
behind O
where O
he O
was O
standing--and O
clearing O
the O
spectators O
from O
his O
vicinity, O
so O
that O
he O
should O
have O
more O
room, O
and O
not O
be O
crowded--the O
whole O
done, O
of O
course, O
in O
expectation O
of O
a O
generous O
largesse. O
From O
time O
to O
time O
other O
gamblers O
would O
hand O
him O
part O
of O
their O
winnings--being O
glad O
to O
let O
him O
stake O
for O
them O
as O
much O
as O
his O
hand O
could O
grasp; O
while O
beside O
him O
stood O
a O
Pole O
in O
a O
state O
of O
violent, O
but O
respectful, O
agitation, O
who, O
also O
in O
expectation O
of O
a O
generous O
largesse, O
kept O
whispering O
to O
him O
at O
intervals O
(probably O
telling O
him O
what O
to O
stake, O
and O
advising O
and O
directing O
his O
play). O
Yet O
never O
once O
did O
the O
player O
throw O
him O
a O
glance O
as O
he O
staked O
and O
staked, O
and O
raked O
in O
his O
winnings. O
Evidently, O
the O
player O
in O
question O
was O
dead O
to O
all O
besides. O
For O
a O
few O
minutes O
the O
Grandmother O
watched O
him. O
"Go O
and O
tell O
him," O
suddenly O
she O
exclaimed O
with O
a O
nudge O
at O
my O
elbow, O
"--go O
and O
tell O
him O
to O
stop, O
and O
to O
take O
his O
money O
with O
him, O
and O
go O
home. O
Presently O
he O
will O
be O
losing--yes, O
losing O
everything O
that O
he O
has O
now O
won." O
She O
seemed O
almost O
breathless O
with O
excitement. O
"Where O
is O
Potapitch?" O
she O
continued. O
"Send O
Potapitch O
to O
speak O
to O
him. O
No, O
YOU O
must O
tell O
him, O
you O
must O
tell O
him,"--here O
she O
nudged O
me O
again--"for O
I O
have O
not O
the O
least O
notion O
where O
Potapitch O
is. O
Sortez, O
sortez," O
she O
shouted O
to O
the O
young O
man, O
until O
I O
leant O
over O
in O
her O
direction O
and O
whispered O
in O
her O
ear O
that O
no O
shouting O
was O
allowed, O
nor O
even O
loud O
speaking, O
since O
to O
do O
so O
disturbed O
the O
calculations O
of O
the O
players, O
and O
might O
lead O
to O
our O
being O
ejected. O
"How O
provoking!" O
she O
retorted. O
"Then O
the O
young O
man O
is O
done O
for! O
I O
suppose O
he O
WISHES O
to O
be O
ruined. O
Yet O
I O
could O
not O
bear O
to O
see O
him O
have O
to O
return O
it O
all. O
What O
a O
fool O
the O
fellow O
is!" O
and O
the O
old O
lady O
turned O
sharply O
away. O
On O
the O
left, O
among O
the O
players O
at O
the O
other O
half O
of O
the O
table, O
a O
young O
lady O
was O
playing, O
with, O
beside O
her, O
a O
dwarf. O
Who O
the O
dwarf O
may O
have O
been--whether O
a O
relative O
or O
a O
person O
whom O
she O
took O
with O
her O
to O
act O
as O
a O
foil--I O
do O
not O
know; O
but O
I O
had O
noticed O
her O
there O
on O
previous O
occasions, O
since, O
everyday, O
she O
entered O
the O
Casino O
at O
one O
o'clock O
precisely, O
and O
departed O
at O
two--thus O
playing O
for O
exactly O
one O
hour. O
Being O
well-known O
to O
the O
attendants, O
she O
always O
had O
a O
seat O
provided O
for O
her; O
and, O
taking O
some O
gold O
and O
a O
few O
thousand-franc O
notes O
out O
of O
her O
pocket--would O
begin O
quietly, O
coldly, O
and O
after O
much O
calculation, O
to O
stake, O
and O
mark O
down O
the O
figures O
in O
pencil O
on O
a O
paper, O
as O
though O
striving O
to O
work O
out O
a O
system O
according O
to O
which, O
at O
given O
moments, O
the O
odds O
might O
group O
themselves. O
Always O
she O
staked O
large O
coins, O
and O
either O
lost O
or O
won O
one, O
two, O
or O
three O
thousand O
francs O
a O
day, O
but O
not O
more; O
after O
which O
she O
would O
depart. O
The O
Grandmother O
took O
a O
long O
look O
at O
her. O
"THAT O
woman O
is O
not O
losing," O
she O
said. O
"To O
whom O
does O
she O
belong? O
Do O
you O
know O
her? O
Who O
is O
she?" O
"She O
is, O
I O
believe, O
a O
Frenchwoman," O
I O
replied. O
"Ah! O
A O
bird O
of O
passage, O
evidently. O
Besides, O
I O
can O
see O
that O
she O
has O
her O
shoes O
polished. O
Now, O
explain O
to O
me O
the O
meaning O
of O
each O
round O
in O
the O
game, O
and O
the O
way O
in O
which O
one O
ought O
to O
stake." O
Upon O
this O
I O
set O
myself O
to O
explain O
the O
meaning O
of O
all O
the O
combinations--of O
"rouge O
et O
noir," O
of O
"pair O
et O
impair," O
of O
"manque O
et O
passe," O
with, O
lastly, O
the O
different O
values O
in O
the O
system O
of O
numbers. O
The O
Grandmother O
listened O
attentively, O
took O
notes, O
put O
questions O
in O
various O
forms, O
and O
laid O
the O
whole O
thing O
to O
heart. O
Indeed, O
since O
an O
example O
of O
each O
system O
of O
stakes O
kept O
constantly O
occurring, O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
information O
could O
be O
assimilated O
with O
ease O
and O
celerity. O
The O
Grandmother O
was O
vastly O
pleased. O
"But O
what O
is O
zero?" O
she O
inquired. O
"Just O
now O
I O
heard O
the O
flaxen-haired O
croupier O
call O
out O
'zero!' O
And O
why O
does O
he O
keep O
raking O
in O
all O
the O
money O
that O
is O
on O
the O
table? O
To O
think O
that O
he O
should O
grab O
the O
whole O
pile O
for O
himself! O
What O
does O
zero O
mean?" O
"Zero O
is O
what O
the O
bank O
takes O
for O
itself. O
If O
the O
wheel O
stops O
at O
that O
figure, O
everything O
lying O
on O
the O
table O
becomes O
the O
absolute O
property O
of O
the O
bank. O
Also, O
whenever O
the O
wheel O
has O
begun O
to O
turn, O
the O
bank O
ceases O
to O
pay O
out O
anything." O
"Then O
I O
should O
receive O
nothing O
if O
I O
were O
staking?" O
"No; O
unless O
by O
any O
chance O
you O
had O
PURPOSELY O
staked O
on O
zero; O
in O
which O
case O
you O
would O
receive O
thirty-five O
times O
the O
value O
of O
your O
stake." O
"Why O
thirty-five O
times, O
when O
zero O
so O
often O
turns O
up? O
And O
if O
so, O
why O
do O
not O
more O
of O
these O
fools O
stake O
upon O
it?" O
"Because O
the O
number O
of O
chances O
against O
its O
occurrence O
is O
thirty-six." O
"Rubbish! O
Potapitch, O
Potapitch! O
Come O
here, O
and O
I O
will O
give O
you O
some O
money." O
The O
old O
lady O
took O
out O
of O
her O
pocket O
a O
tightly-clasped O
purse, O
and O
extracted O
from O
its O
depths O
a O
ten-gulden O
piece. O
"Go O
at O
once, O
and O
stake O
that O
upon O
zero." O
"But, O
Madame, O
zero O
has O
only O
this O
moment O
turned O
up," O
I O
remonstrated; O
"wherefore, O
it O
may O
not O
do O
so O
again O
for O
ever O
so O
long. O
Wait O
a O
little, O
and O
you O
may O
then O
have O
a O
better O
chance." O
"Rubbish! O
Stake, O
please." O
"Pardon O
me, O
but O
zero O
might O
not O
turn O
up O
again O
until, O
say, O
tonight, O
even O
though O
you O
had O
staked O
thousands O
upon O
it. O
It O
often O
happens O
so." O
"Rubbish, O
rubbish! O
Who O
fears O
the O
wolf O
should O
never O
enter O
the O
forest. O
What? O
We O
have O
lost? O
Then O
stake O
again." O
A O
second O
ten-gulden O
piece O
did O
we O
lose, O
and O
then O
I O
put O
down O
a O
third. O
The O
Grandmother O
could O
scarcely O
remain O
seated O
in O
her O
chair, O
so O
intent O
was O
she O
upon O
the O
little O
ball O
as O
it O
leapt O
through O
the O
notches O
of O
the O
ever-revolving O
wheel. O
However, O
the O
third O
ten-gulden O
piece O
followed O
the O
first O
two. O
Upon O
this O
the O
Grandmother O
went O
perfectly O
crazy. O
She O
could O
no O
longer O
sit O
still, O
and O
actually O
struck O
the O
table O
with O
her O
fist O
when O
the O
croupier O
cried O
out, O
"Trente-six," O
instead O
of O
the O
desiderated O
zero. O
"To O
listen O
to O
him!" O
fumed O
the O
old O
lady. O
"When O
will O
that O
accursed O
zero O
ever O
turn O
up? O
I O
cannot O
breathe O
until O
I O
see O
it. O
I O
believe O
that O
that O
infernal O
croupier O
is O
PURPOSELY O
keeping O
it O
from O
turning O
up. O
Alexis PERSON
Ivanovitch, O
stake O
TWO O
golden O
pieces O
this O
time. O
The O
moment O
we O
cease O
to O
stake, O
that O
cursed O
zero O
will O
come O
turning O
up, O
and O
we O
shall O
get O
nothing." O
"My O
good O
Madame--" O
"Stake, O
stake! O
It O
is O
not O
YOUR O
money." O
Accordingly O
I O
staked O
two O
ten-gulden O
pieces. O
The O
ball O
went O
hopping O
round O
the O
wheel O
until O
it O
began O
to O
settle O
through O
the O
notches. O
Meanwhile O
the O
Grandmother O
sat O
as O
though O
petrified, O
with O
my O
hand O
convulsively O
clutched O
in O
hers. O
"Zero!" O
called O
the O
croupier. O
"There! O
You O
see, O
you O
see!" O
cried O
the O
old O
lady, O
as O
she O
turned O
and O
faced O
me, O
wreathed O
in O
smiles. O
"I O
told O
you O
so! O
It O
was O
the O
Lord O
God O
himself O
who O
suggested O
to O
me O
to O
stake O
those O
two O
coins. O
Now, O
how O
much O
ought O
I O
to O
receive? O
Why O
do O
they O
not O
pay O
it O
out O
to O
me? O
Potapitch! O
Martha! O
Where O
are O
they? O
What O
has O
become O
of O
our O
party? O
Potapitch, O
Potapitch!" O
"Presently, O
Madame," O
I O
whispered. O
"Potapitch O
is O
outside, O
and O
they O
would O
decline O
to O
admit O
him O
to O
these O
rooms. O
See! O
You O
are O
being O
paid O
out O
your O
money. O
Pray O
take O
it." O
The O
croupiers O
were O
making O
up O
a O
heavy O
packet O
of O
coins, O
sealed O
in O
blue O
paper, O
and O
containing O
fifty O
ten O
gulden O
pieces, O
together O
with O
an O
unsealed O
packet O
containing O
another O
twenty. O
I O
handed O
the O
whole O
to O
the O
old O
lady O
in O
a O
money-shovel. O
"Faites O
le O
jeu, O
messieurs! O
Faites O
le O
jeu, O
messieurs! O
Rien O
ne O
va O
plus," O
proclaimed O
the O
croupier O
as O
once O
more O
he O
invited O
the O
company O
to O
stake, O
and O
prepared O
to O
turn O
the O
wheel. O
"We O
shall O
be O
too O
late! O
He O
is O
going O
to O
spin O
again! O
Stake, O
stake!" O
The O
Grandmother O
was O
in O
a O
perfect O
fever. O
"Do O
not O
hang O
back! O
Be O
quick!" O
She O
seemed O
almost O
beside O
herself, O
and O
nudged O
me O
as O
hard O
as O
she O
could. O
"Upon O
what O
shall O
I O
stake, O
Madame?" O
"Upon O
zero, O
upon O
zero! O
Again O
upon O
zero! O
Stake O
as O
much O
as O
ever O
you O
can. O
How O
much O
have O
we O
got? O
Seventy O
ten-gulden O
pieces? O
We O
shall O
not O
miss O
them, O
so O
stake O
twenty O
pieces O
at O
a O
time." O
"Think O
a O
moment, O
Madame. O
Sometimes O
zero O
does O
not O
turn O
up O
for O
two O
hundred O
rounds O
in O
succession. O
I O
assure O
you O
that O
you O
may O
lose O
all O
your O
capital." O
"You O
are O
wrong--utterly O
wrong. O
Stake, O
I O
tell O
you! O
What O
a O
chattering O
tongue O
you O
have! O
I O
know O
perfectly O
well O
what O
I O
am O
doing." O
The O
old O
lady O
was O
shaking O
with O
excitement. O
"But O
the O
rules O
do O
not O
allow O
of O
more O
than O
120 O
gulden O
being O
staked O
upon O
zero O
at O
a O
time." O
"How O
'do O
not O
allow'? O
Surely O
you O
are O
wrong? O
Monsieur, O
monsieur--" O
here O
she O
nudged O
the O
croupier O
who O
was O
sitting O
on O
her O
left, O
and O
preparing O
to O
spin--"combien O
zero? O
Douze? O
Douze?" O
I O
hastened O
to O
translate. O
"Oui, O
Madame," O
was O
the O
croupier's O
polite O
reply. O
"No O
single O
stake O
must O
exceed O
four O
thousand O
florins. O
That O
is O
the O
regulation." O
"Then O
there O
is O
nothing O
else O
for O
it. O
We O
must O
risk O
in O
gulden." O
"Le O
jeu O
est O
fait!" O
the O
croupier O
called. O
The O
wheel O
revolved, O
and O
stopped O
at O
thirty. O
We O
had O
lost! O
"Again, O
again, O
again! O
Stake O
again!" O
shouted O
the O
old O
lady. O
Without O
attempting O
to O
oppose O
her O
further, O
but O
merely O
shrugging O
my O
shoulders, O
I O
placed O
twelve O
more O
ten-gulden O
pieces O
upon O
the O
table. O
The O
wheel O
whirled O
around O
and O
around, O
with O
the O
Grandmother O
simply O
quaking O
as O
she O
watched O
its O
revolutions. O
"Does O
she O
again O
think O
that O
zero O
is O
going O
to O
be O
the O
winning O
coup?" O
thought O
I, O
as O
I O
stared O
at O
her O
in O
astonishment. O
Yet O
an O
absolute O
assurance O
of O
winning O
was O
shining O
on O
her O
face; O
she O
looked O
perfectly O
convinced O
that O
zero O
was O
about O
to O
be O
called O
again. O
At O
length O
the O
ball O
dropped O
off O
into O
one O
of O
the O
notches. O
"Zero!" O
cried O
the O
croupier. O
"Ah!!!" O
screamed O
the O
old O
lady O
as O
she O
turned O
to O
me O
in O
a O
whirl O
of O
triumph. O
I O
myself O
was O
at O
heart O
a O
gambler. O
At O
that O
moment O
I O
became O
acutely O
conscious O
both O
of O
that O
fact O
and O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
my O
hands O
and O
knees O
were O
shaking, O
and O
that O
the O
blood O
was O
beating O
in O
my O
brain. O
Of O
course O
this O
was O
a O
rare O
occasion--an O
occasion O
on O
which O
zero O
had O
turned O
up O
no O
less O
than O
three O
times O
within O
a O
dozen O
rounds; O
yet O
in O
such O
an O
event O
there O
was O
nothing O
so O
very O
surprising, O
seeing O
that, O
only O
three O
days O
ago, O
I O
myself O
had O
been O
a O
witness O
to O
zero O
turning O
up O
THREE O
TIMES O
IN O
SUCCESSION, O
so O
that O
one O
of O
the O
players O
who O
was O
recording O
the O
coups O
on O
paper O
was O
moved O
to O
remark O
that O
for O
several O
days O
past O
zero O
had O
never O
turned O
up O
at O
all! O
With O
the O
Grandmother, O
as O
with O
any O
one O
who O
has O
won O
a O
very O
large O
sum, O
the O
management O
settled O
up O
with O
great O
attention O
and O
respect, O
since O
she O
was O
fortunate O
to O
have O
to O
receive O
no O
less O
than O
4200 O
gulden. O
Of O
these O
gulden O
the O
odd O
200 O
were O
paid O
her O
in O
gold, O
and O
the O
remainder O
in O
bank O
notes. O
This O
time O
the O
old O
lady O
did O
not O
call O
for O
Potapitch; O
for O
that O
she O
was O
too O
preoccupied. O
Though O
not O
outwardly O
shaken O
by O
the O
event O
(indeed, O
she O
seemed O
perfectly O
calm), O
she O
was O
trembling O
inwardly O
from O
head O
to O
foot. O
At O
length, O
completely O
absorbed O
in O
the O
game, O
she O
burst O
out: O
"Alexis O
Ivanovitch, O
did O
not O
the O
croupier O
just O
say O
that O
4000 O
florins O
were O
the O
most O
that O
could O
be O
staked O
at O
any O
one O
time? O
Well, O
take O
these O
4000, O
and O
stake O
them O
upon O
the O
red." O
To O
oppose O
her O
was O
useless. O
Once O
more O
the O
wheel O
revolved. O
"Rouge!" O
proclaimed O
the O
croupier. O
Again O
4000 O
florins--in O
all O
8000! O
"Give O
me O
them," O
commanded O
the O
Grandmother, O
"and O
stake O
the O
other O
4000 O
upon O
the O
red O
again." O
I O
did O
so. O
"Rouge!" O
proclaimed O
the O
croupier. O
"Twelve O
thousand!" O
cried O
the O
old O
lady. O
"Hand O
me O
the O
whole O
lot. O
Put O
the O
gold O
into O
this O
purse O
here, O
and O
count O
the O
bank O
notes. O
Enough! O
Let O
us O
go O
home. O
Wheel O
my O
chair O
away." O
XI O
THE O
chair, O
with O
the O
old O
lady O
beaming O
in O
it, O
was O
wheeled O
away O
towards O
the O
doors O
at O
the O
further O
end O
of O
the O
salon, O
while O
our O
party O
hastened O
to O
crowd O
around O
her, O
and O
to O
offer O
her O
their O
congratulations. O
In O
fact, O
eccentric O
as O
was O
her O
conduct, O
it O
was O
also O
overshadowed O
by O
her O
triumph; O
with O
the O
result O
that O
the O
General O
no O
longer O
feared O
to O
be O
publicly O
compromised O
by O
being O
seen O
with O
such O
a O
strange O
woman, O
but, O
smiling O
in O
a O
condescending, O
cheerfully O
familiar O
way, O
as O
though O
he O
were O
soothing O
a O
child, O
he O
offered O
his O
greetings O
to O
the O
old O
lady. O
At O
the O
same O
time, O
both O
he O
and O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
spectators O
were O
visibly O
impressed. O
Everywhere O
people O
kept O
pointing O
to O
the O
Grandmother, O
and O
talking O
about O
her. O
Many O
people O
even O
walked O
beside O
her O
chair, O
in O
order O
to O
view O
her O
the O
better O
while, O
at O
a O
little O
distance, O
Astley PERSON
was O
carrying O
on O
a O
conversation O
on O
the O
subject O
with O
two O
English O
acquaintances O
of O
his. O
De PERSON
Griers PERSON
was O
simply O
overflowing O
with O
smiles O
and O
compliments, O
and O
a O
number O
of O
fine O
ladies O
were O
staring O
at O
the O
Grandmother O
as O
though O
she O
had O
been O
something O
curious. O
"Quelle O
victoire!" O
exclaimed O
De O
Griers. O
"Mais, O
Madame, O
c'etait O
du O
feu!" O
added O
Mlle. O
Blanche O
with O
an O
elusive O
smile. O
"Yes, O
I O
have O
won O
twelve O
thousand O
florins," O
replied O
the O
old O
lady. O
"And O
then O
there O
is O
all O
this O
gold. O
With O
it O
the O
total O
ought O
to O
come O
to O
nearly O
thirteen O
thousand. O
How O
much O
is O
that O
in O
Russian O
money? O
Six O
thousand O
roubles, O
I O
think?" O
However, O
I O
calculated O
that O
the O
sum O
would O
exceed O
seven O
thousand O
roubles--or, O
at O
the O
present O
rate O
of O
exchange, O
even O
eight O
thousand. O
"Eight O
thousand O
roubles! O
What O
a O
splendid O
thing! O
And O
to O
think O
of O
you O
simpletons O
sitting O
there O
and O
doing O
nothing! O
Potapitch! O
Martha! O
See O
what O
I O
have O
won!" O
"How O
DID O
you O
do O
it, O
Madame?" O
Martha PERSON
exclaimed O
ecstatically. O
"Eight O
thousand O
roubles!" O
"And O
I O
am O
going O
to O
give O
you O
fifty O
gulden O
apiece. O
There O
they O
are." O
Potapitch O
and O
Martha PERSON
rushed O
towards O
her O
to O
kiss O
her O
hand. O
"And O
to O
each O
bearer O
also O
I O
will O
give O
a O
ten-gulden O
piece. O
Let O
them O
have O
it O
out O
of O
the O
gold, O
Alexis PERSON
Ivanovitch. O
But O
why O
is O
this O
footman O
bowing O
to O
me, O
and O
that O
other O
man O
as O
well? O
Are O
they O
congratulating O
me? O
Well, O
let O
them O
have O
ten O
gulden O
apiece." O
"Madame O
la O
princesse--Un O
pauvre O
expatrie--Malheur O
continuel--Les O
princes O
russes O
sont O
si O
genereux!" O
said O
a O
man O
who O
for O
some O
time O
past O
had O
been O
hanging O
around O
the O
old O
lady's O
chair--a O
personage O
who, O
dressed O
in O
a O
shabby O
frockcoat O
and O
coloured O
waistcoat, O
kept O
taking O
off O
his O
cap, O
and O
smiling O
pathetically. O
"Give O
him O
ten O
gulden," O
said O
the O
Grandmother. O
"No, O
give O
him O
twenty. O
Now, O
enough O
of O
that, O
or O
I O
shall O
never O
get O
done O
with O
you O
all. O
Take O
a O
moment's O
rest, O
and O
then O
carry O
me O
away. O
Prascovia, O
I O
mean O
to O
buy O
a O
new O
dress O
for O
you O
tomorrow. O
Yes, O
and O
for O
you O
too, O
Mlle. O
Blanche. O
Please O
translate, O
Prascovia." O
"Merci, O
Madame," O
replied O
Mlle. O
Blanche O
gratefully O
as O
she O
twisted O
her O
face O
into O
the O
mocking O
smile O
which O
usually O
she O
kept O
only O
for O
the O
benefit O
of O
De PERSON
Griers PERSON
and O
the O
General. O
The O
latter O
looked O
confused, O
and O
seemed O
greatly O
relieved O
when O
we O
reached O
the O
Avenue. O
"How O
surprised O
Theodosia LOCATION
too O
will O
be!" O
went O
on O
the O
Grandmother O
(thinking O
of O
the O
General's O
nursemaid). O
"She, O
like O
yourselves, O
shall O
have O
the O
price O
of O
a O
new O
gown. O
Here, O
Alexis PERSON
Ivanovitch! O
Give O
that O
beggar O
something" O
(a O
crooked-backed O
ragamuffin O
had O
approached O
to O
stare O
at O
us). O
"But O
perhaps O
he O
is O
NOT O
a O
beggar--only O
a O
rascal," O
I O
replied. O
"Never O
mind, O
never O
mind. O
Give O
him O
a O
gulden." O
I O
approached O
the O
beggar O
in O
question, O
and O
handed O
him O
the O
coin. O
Looking O
at O
me O
in O
great O
astonishment, O
he O
silently O
accepted O
the O
gulden, O
while O
from O
his O
person O
there O
proceeded O
a O
strong O
smell O
of O
liquor. O
"Have O
you O
never O
tried O
your O
luck, O
Alexis PERSON
Ivanovitch?" O
"No, O
Madame." O
"Yet O
just O
now O
I O
could O
see O
that O
you O
were O
burning O
to O
do O
so?" O
"I O
do O
mean O
to O
try O
my O
luck O
presently." O
"Then O
stake O
everything O
upon O
zero. O
You O
have O
seen O
how O
it O
ought O
to O
be O
done? O
How O
much O
capital O
do O
you O
possess?" O
"Two O
hundred O
gulden, O
Madame." O
"Not O
very O
much. O
See O
here; O
I O
will O
lend O
you O
five O
hundred O
if O
you O
wish. O
Take O
this O
purse O
of O
mine." O
With O
that O
she O
added O
sharply O
to O
the O
General: O
"But O
YOU O
need O
not O
expect O
to O
receive O
any." O
This O
seemed O
to O
upset O
him, O
but O
he O
said O
nothing, O
and O
De PERSON
Griers PERSON
contented O
himself O
by O
scowling. O
"Que O
diable!" O
he O
whispered O
to O
the O
General. O
"C'est O
une O
terrible O
vieille." O
"Look! O
Another O
beggar, O
another O
beggar!" O
exclaimed O
the O
grandmother. O
"Alexis O
Ivanovitch, O
go O
and O
give O
him O
a O
gulden." O
As O
she O
spoke O
I O
saw O
approaching O
us O
a O
grey-headed O
old O
man O
with O
a O
wooden O
leg--a O
man O
who O
was O
dressed O
in O
a O
blue O
frockcoat O
and O
carrying O
a O
staff. O
He O
looked O
like O
an O
old O
soldier. O
As O
soon O
as O
I O
tendered O
him O
the O
coin O
he O
fell O
back O
a O
step O
or O
two, O
and O
eyed O
me O
threateningly. O
"Was O
ist O
der O
Teufel!" O
he O
cried, O
and O
appended O
thereto O
a O
round O
dozen O
of O
oaths. O
"The O
man O
is O
a O
perfect O
fool!" O
exclaimed O
the O
Grandmother, O
waving O
her O
hand. O
"Move O
on O
now, O
for O
I O
am O
simply O
famished. O
When O
we O
have O
lunched O
we O
will O
return O
to O
that O
place." O
"What?" O
cried O
I. O
"You O
are O
going O
to O
play O
again?" O
"What O
else O
do O
you O
suppose?" O
she O
retorted. O
"Are O
you O
going O
only O
to O
sit O
here, O
and O
grow O
sour, O
and O
let O
me O
look O
at O
you?" O
"Madame," O
said O
De O
Griers O
confidentially, O
"les O
chances O
peuvent O
tourner. O
Une O
seule O
mauvaise O
chance, O
et O
vous O
perdrez O
tout--surtout O
avec O
votre O
jeu. O
C'etait O
terrible!" O
"Oui; O
vous O
perdrez O
absolument," O
put O
in O
Mlle. O
Blanche. O
"What O
has O
that O
got O
to O
do O
with O
YOU?" O
retorted O
the O
old O
lady. O
"It O
is O
not O
YOUR O
money O
that O
I O
am O
going O
to O
lose; O
it O
is O
my O
own. O
And O
where O
is O
that O
Mr. O
Astley PERSON
of O
yours?" O
she O
added O
to O
myself. O
"He O
stayed O
behind O
in O
the O
Casino." O
"What O
a O
pity! O
He O
is O
such O
a O
nice O
sort O
of O
man!" O
Arriving O
home, O
and O
meeting O
the O
landlord O
on O
the O
staircase, O
the O
Grandmother O
called O
him O
to O
her O
side, O
and O
boasted O
to O
him O
of O
her O
winnings--thereafter O
doing O
the O
same O
to O
Theodosia, O
and O
conferring O
upon O
her O
thirty O
gulden; O
after O
which O
she O
bid O
her O
serve O
luncheon. O
The O
meal O
over, O
Theodosia PERSON
and O
Martha PERSON
broke O
into O
a O
joint O
flood O
of O
ecstasy. O
"I O
was O
watching O
you O
all O
the O
time, O
Madame," O
quavered O
Martha, O
"and O
I O
asked O
Potapitch PERSON
what O
mistress O
was O
trying O
to O
do. O
And, O
my O
word! O
the O
heaps O
and O
heaps O
of O
money O
that O
were O
lying O
upon O
the O
table! O
Never O
in O
my O
life O
have O
I O
seen O
so O
much O
money. O
And O
there O
were O
gentlefolk O
around O
it, O
and O
other O
gentlefolk O
sitting O
down. O
So, O
I O
asked O
Potapitch PERSON
where O
all O
these O
gentry O
had O
come O
from; O
for, O
thought O
I, O
maybe O
the O
Holy O
Mother O
of O
God O
will O
help O
our O
mistress O
among O
them. O
Yes, O
I O
prayed O
for O
you, O
Madame, O
and O
my O
heart O
died O
within O
me, O
so O
that O
I O
kept O
trembling O
and O
trembling. O
The O
Lord O
be O
with O
her, O
I O
thought O
to O
myself; O
and O
in O
answer O
to O
my O
prayer O
He O
has O
now O
sent O
you O
what O
He O
has O
done! O
Even O
yet O
I O
tremble--I O
tremble O
to O
think O
of O
it O
all." O
"Alexis O
Ivanovitch," O
said O
the O
old O
lady, O
"after O
luncheon,--that O
is O
to O
say, O
about O
four O
o'clock--get O
ready O
to O
go O
out O
with O
me O
again. O
But O
in O
the O
meanwhile, O
good-bye. O
Do O
not O
forget O
to O
call O
a O
doctor, O
for O
I O
must O
take O
the O
waters. O
Now O
go O
and O
get O
rested O
a O
little." O
I O
left O
the O
Grandmother's O
presence O
in O
a O
state O
of O
bewilderment. O
Vainly O
I O
endeavoured O
to O
imagine O
what O
would O
become O
of O
our O
party, O
or O
what O
turn O
the O
affair O
would O
next O
take. O
I O
could O
perceive O
that O
none O
of O
the O
party O
had O
yet O
recovered O
their O
presence O
of O
mind--least O
of O
all O
the O
General. O
The O
factor O
of O
the O
Grandmother's O
appearance O
in O
place O
of O
the O
hourly O
expected O
telegram O
to O
announce O
her O
death O
(with, O
of O
course, O
resultant O
legacies) O
had O
so O
upset O
the O
whole O
scheme O
of O
intentions O
and O
projects O
that O
it O
was O
with O
a O
decided O
feeling O
of O
apprehension O
and O
growing O
paralysis O
that O
the O
conspirators O
viewed O
any O
future O
performances O
of O
the O
old O
lady O
at O
roulette. O
Yet O
this O
second O
factor O
was O
not O
quite O
so O
important O
as O
the O
first, O
since, O
though O
the O
Grandmother O
had O
twice O
declared O
that O
she O
did O
not O
intend O
to O
give O
the O
General O
any O
money, O
that O
declaration O
was O
not O
a O
complete O
ground O
for O
the O
abandonment O
of O
hope. O
Certainly O
De O
Griers, O
who, O
with O
the O
General, O
was O
up O
to O
the O
neck O
in O
the O
affair, O
had O
not O
wholly O
lost O
courage; O
and O
I O
felt O
sure O
that O
Mlle. O
Blanche O
also--Mlle. O
Blanche O
who O
was O
not O
only O
as O
deeply O
involved O
as O
the O
other O
two, O
but O
also O
expectant O
of O
becoming O
Madame O
General O
and O
an O
important O
legatee--would O
not O
lightly O
surrender O
the O
position, O
but O
would O
use O
her O
every O
resource O
of O
coquetry O
upon O
the O
old O
lady, O
in O
order O
to O
afford O
a O
contrast O
to O
the O
impetuous O
Polina, O
who O
was O
difficult O
to O
understand, O
and O
lacked O
the O
art O
of O
pleasing. O
Yet O
now, O
when O
the O
Grandmother O
had O
just O
performed O
an O
astonishing O
feat O
at O
roulette; O
now, O
when O
the O
old O
lady's O
personality O
had O
been O
so O
clearly O
and O
typically O
revealed O
as O
that O
of O
a O
rugged, O
arrogant O
woman O
who O
was O
"tombee O
en O
enfance"; O
now, O
when O
everything O
appeared O
to O
be O
lost,--why, O
now O
the O
Grandmother O
was O
as O
merry O
as O
a O
child O
which O
plays O
with O
thistle-down. O
"Good O
Lord!" O
I O
thought O
with, O
may O
God O
forgive O
me, O
a O
most O
malicious O
smile, O
"every O
ten-gulden O
piece O
which O
the O
Grandmother O
staked O
must O
have O
raised O
a O
blister O
on O
the O
General's O
heart, O
and O
maddened O
De O
Griers, O
and O
driven O
Mlle. O
de O
Cominges O
almost O
to O
frenzy O
with O
the O
sight O
of O
this O
spoon O
dangling O
before O
her O
lips." O
Another O
factor O
is O
the O
circumstance O
that O
even O
when, O
overjoyed O
at O
winning, O
the O
Grandmother O
was O
distributing O
alms O
right O
and O
left, O
and O
taking O
every O
one O
to O
be O
a O
beggar, O
she O
again O
snapped O
out O
to O
the O
General O
that O
he O
was O
not O
going O
to O
be O
allowed O
any O
of O
her O
money--which O
meant O
that O
the O
old O
lady O
had O
quite O
made O
up O
her O
mind O
on O
the O
point, O
and O
was O
sure O
of O
it. O
Yes, O
danger O
loomed O
ahead. O
All O
these O
thoughts O
passed O
through O
my O
mind O
during O
the O
few O
moments O
that, O
having O
left O
the O
old O
lady's O
rooms, O
I O
was O
ascending O
to O
my O
own O
room O
on O
the O
top O
storey. O
What O
most O
struck O
me O
was O
the O
fact O
that, O
though O
I O
had O
divined O
the O
chief, O
the O
stoutest, O
threads O
which O
united O
the O
various O
actors O
in O
the O
drama, O
I O
had, O
until O
now, O
been O
ignorant O
of O
the O
methods O
and O
secrets O
of O
the O
game. O
For O
Polina PERSON
had O
never O
been O
completely O
open O
with O
me. O
Although, O
on O
occasions, O
it O
had O
happened O
that O
involuntarily, O
as O
it O
were, O
she O
had O
revealed O
to O
me O
something O
of O
her O
heart, O
I O
had O
noticed O
that O
in O
most O
cases--in O
fact, O
nearly O
always--she O
had O
either O
laughed O
away O
these O
revelations, O
or O
grown O
confused, O
or O
purposely O
imparted O
to O
them O
a O
false O
guise. O
Yes, O
she O
must O
have O
concealed O
a O
great O
deal O
from O
me. O
But, O
I O
had O
a O
presentiment O
that O
now O
the O
end O
of O
this O
strained O
and O
mysterious O
situation O
was O
approaching. O
Another O
stroke, O
and O
all O
would O
be O
finished O
and O
exposed. O
Of O
my O
own O
fortunes, O
interested O
though O
I O
was O
in O
the O
affair, O
I O
took O
no O
account. O
I O
was O
in O
the O
strange O
position O
of O
possessing O
but O
two O
hundred O
gulden, O
of O
being O
at O
a O
loose O
end, O
of O
lacking O
both O
a O
post, O
the O
means O
of O
subsistence, O
a O
shred O
of O
hope, O
and O
any O
plans O
for O
the O
future, O
yet O
of O
caring O
nothing O
for O
these O
things. O
Had O
not O
my O
mind O
been O
so O
full O
of O
Polina, O
I O
should O
have O
given O
myself O
up O
to O
the O
comical O
piquancy O
of O
the O
impending O
denouement, O
and O
laughed O
my O
fill O
at O
it. O
But O
the O
thought O
of O
Polina PERSON
was O
torture O
to O
me. O
That O
her O
fate O
was O
settled O
I O
already O
had O
an O
inkling; O
yet O
that O
was O
not O
the O
thought O
which O
was O
giving O
me O
so O
much O
uneasiness. O
What O
I O
really O
wished O
for O
was O
to O
penetrate O
her O
secrets. O
I O
wanted O
her O
to O
come O
to O
me O
and O
say, O
"I O
love O
you," O
and, O
if O
she O
would O
not O
so O
come, O
or O
if O
to O
hope O
that O
she O
would O
ever O
do O
so O
was O
an O
unthinkable O
absurdity--why, O
then O
there O
was O
nothing O
else O
for O
me O
to O
want. O
Even O
now O
I O
do O
not O
know O
what O
I O
am O
wanting. O
I O
feel O
like O
a O
man O
who O
has O
lost O
his O
way. O
I O
yearn O
but O
to O
be O
in O
her O
presence, O
and O
within O
the O
circle O
of O
her O
light O
and O
splendour--to O
be O
there O
now, O
and O
forever, O
and O
for O
the O
whole O
of O
my O
life. O
More O
I O
do O
not O
know. O
How O
can O
I O
ever O
bring O
myself O
to O
leave O
her? O
On O
reaching O
the O
third O
storey O
of O
the O
hotel O
I O
experienced O
a O
shock. O
I O
was O
just O
passing O
the O
General's O
suite O
when O
something O
caused O
me O
to O
look O
round. O
Out O
of O
a O
door O
about O
twenty O
paces O
away O
there O
was O
coming O
Polina! O
She O
hesitated O
for O
a O
moment O
on O
seeing O
me, O
and O
then O
beckoned O
me O
to O
her. O
"Polina O
Alexandrovna!" O
"Hush! O
Not O
so O
loud." O
"Something O
startled O
me O
just O
now," O
I O
whispered, O
"and O
I O
looked O
round, O
and O
saw O
you. O
Some O
electrical O
influence O
seems O
to O
emanate O
from O
your O
form." O
"Take O
this O
letter," O
she O
went O
on O
with O
a O
frown O
(probably O
she O
had O
not O
even O
heard O
my O
words, O
she O
was O
so O
preoccupied), O
"and O
hand O
it O
personally O
to O
Mr. O
Astley. O
Go O
as O
quickly O
as O
ever O
you O
can, O
please. O
No O
answer O
will O
be O
required. O
He O
himself--" O
She O
did O
not O
finish O
her O
sentence. O
"To O
Mr. O
Astley?" O
I O
asked, O
in O
some O
astonishment. O
But O
she O
had O
vanished O
again. O
Aha! O
So O
the O
two O
were O
carrying O
on O
a O
correspondence! O
However, O
I O
set O
off O
to O
search O
for O
Astley--first O
at O
his O
hotel, O
and O
then O
at O
the O
Casino, O
where O
I O
went O
the O
round O
of O
the O
salons O
in O
vain. O
At O
length, O
vexed, O
and O
almost O
in O
despair, O
I O
was O
on O
my O
way O
home O
when O
I O
ran O
across O
him O
among O
a O
troop O
of O
English O
ladies O
and O
gentlemen O
who O
had O
been O
out O
for O
a O
ride. O
Beckoning O
to O
him O
to O
stop, O
I O
handed O
him O
the O
letter. O
We O
had O
barely O
time O
even O
to O
look O
at O
one O
another, O
but O
I O
suspected O
that O
it O
was O
of O
set O
purpose O
that O
he O
restarted O
his O
horse O
so O
quickly. O
Was O
jealousy, O
then, O
gnawing O
at O
me? O
At O
all O
events, O
I O
felt O
exceedingly O
depressed, O
despite O
the O
fact O
that O
I O
had O
no O
desire O
to O
ascertain O
what O
the O
correspondence O
was O
about. O
To O
think O
that O
HE O
should O
be O
her O
confidant! O
"My O
friend, O
mine O
own O
familiar O
friend!" O
passed O
through O
my O
mind. O
Yet O
WAS O
there O
any O
love O
in O
the O
matter? O
"Of O
course O
not," O
reason O
whispered O
to O
me. O
But O
reason O
goes O
for O
little O
on O
such O
occasions. O
I O
felt O
that O
the O
matter O
must O
be O
cleared O
up, O
for O
it O
was O
becoming O
unpleasantly O
complex. O
I O
had O
scarcely O
set O
foot O
in O
the O
hotel O
when O
the O
commissionaire O
and O
the O
landlord O
(the O
latter O
issuing O
from O
his O
room O
for O
the O
purpose) O
alike O
informed O
me O
that O
I O
was O
being O
searched O
for O
high O
and O
low--that O
three O
separate O
messages O
to O
ascertain O
my O
whereabouts O
had O
come O
down O
from O
the O
General. O
When O
I O
entered O
his O
study O
I O
was O
feeling O
anything O
but O
kindly O
disposed. O
I O
found O
there O
the O
General O
himself, O
De O
Griers, O
and O
Mlle. O
Blanche, O
but O
not O
Mlle.'s O
mother, O
who O
was O
a O
person O
whom O
her O
reputed O
daughter O
used O
only O
for O
show O
purposes, O
since O
in O
all O
matters O
of O
business O
the O
daughter O
fended O
for O
herself, O
and O
it O
is O
unlikely O
that O
the O
mother O
knew O
anything O
about O
them. O
Some O
very O
heated O
discussion O
was O
in O
progress, O
and O
meanwhile O
the O
door O
of O
the O
study O
was O
open--an O
unprecedented O
circumstance. O
As O
I O
approached O
the O
portals O
I O
could O
hear O
loud O
voices O
raised, O
for O
mingled O
with O
the O
pert, O
venomous O
accents O
of O
De O
Griers O
were O
Mlle. O
Blanche's O
excited, O
impudently O
abusive O
tongue O
and O
the O
General's O
plaintive O
wail O
as, O
apparently, O
he O
sought O
to O
justify O
himself O
in O
something. O
But O
on O
my O
appearance O
every O
one O
stopped O
speaking, O
and O
tried O
to O
put O
a O
better O
face O
upon O
matters. O
De PERSON
Griers PERSON
smoothed O
his O
hair, O
and O
twisted O
his O
angry O
face O
into O
a O
smile--into O
the O
mean, O
studiedly O
polite O
French O
smile O
which O
I O
so O
detested; O
while O
the O
downcast, O
perplexed O
General O
assumed O
an O
air O
of O
dignity--though O
only O
in O
a O
mechanical O
way. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
Mlle. O
Blanche PERSON
did O
not O
trouble O
to O
conceal O
the O
wrath O
that O
was O
sparkling O
in O
her O
countenance, O
but O
bent O
her O
gaze O
upon O
me O
with O
an O
air O
of O
impatient O
expectancy. O
I O
may O
remark O
that O
hitherto O
she O
had O
treated O
me O
with O
absolute O
superciliousness, O
and, O
so O
far O
from O
answering O
my O
salutations, O
had O
always O
ignored O
them. O
"Alexis O
Ivanovitch," O
began O
the O
General O
in O
a O
tone O
of O
affectionate O
upbraiding, O
"may O
I O
say O
to O
you O
that O
I O
find O
it O
strange, O
exceedingly O
strange, O
that--In O
short, O
your O
conduct O
towards O
myself O
and O
my O
family-- O
In O
a O
word, O
your--er--extremely--" O
"Eh! O
Ce O
n'est O
pas O
ca," O
interrupted O
De PERSON
Griers PERSON
in O
a O
tone O
of O
impatience O
and O
contempt O
(evidently O
he O
was O
the O
ruling O
spirit O
of O
the O
conclave). O
"Mon O
cher O
monsieur, O
notre O
general O
se O
trompe. O
What O
he O
means O
to O
say O
is O
that O
he O
warns O
you--he O
begs O
of O
you O
most O
earnestly--not O
to O
ruin O
him. O
I O
use O
the O
expression O
because--" O
"Why? O
Why?" O
I O
interjected. O
"Because O
you O
have O
taken O
upon O
yourself O
to O
act O
as O
guide O
to O
this, O
to O
this--how O
shall O
I O
express O
it?--to O
this O
old O
lady, O
a O
cette O
pauvre O
terrible O
vieille. O
But O
she O
will O
only O
gamble O
away O
all O
that O
she O
has--gamble O
it O
away O
like O
thistledown. O
You O
yourself O
have O
seen O
her O
play. O
Once O
she O
has O
acquired O
the O
taste O
for O
gambling, O
she O
will O
never O
leave O
the O
roulette-table, O
but, O
of O
sheer O
perversity O
and O
temper, O
will O
stake O
her O
all, O
and O
lose O
it. O
In O
cases O
such O
as O
hers O
a O
gambler O
can O
never O
be O
torn O
away O
from O
the O
game; O
and O
then--and O
then--" O
"And O
then," O
asseverated O
the O
General, O
"you O
will O
have O
ruined O
my O
whole O
family. O
I O
and O
my O
family O
are O
her O
heirs, O
for O
she O
has O
no O
nearer O
relatives O
than O
ourselves. O
I O
tell O
you O
frankly O
that O
my O
affairs O
are O
in O
great--very O
great O
disorder; O
how O
much O
they O
are O
so O
you O
yourself O
are O
partially O
aware. O
If O
she O
should O
lose O
a O
large O
sum, O
or, O
maybe, O
her O
whole O
fortune, O
what O
will O
become O
of O
us--of O
my O
children" O
(here O
the O
General O
exchanged O
a O
glance O
with O
De O
Griers) O
"or O
of O
me?" O
(here O
he O
looked O
at O
Mlle. O
Blanche, O
who O
turned O
her O
head O
contemptuously O
away). O
"Alexis O
Ivanovitch, O
I O
beg O
of O
you O
to O
save O
us." O
"Tell O
me, O
General, O
how O
am O
I O
to O
do O
so? O
On O
what O
footing O
do O
I O
stand O
here?" O
"Refuse O
to O
take O
her O
about. O
Simply O
leave O
her O
alone." O
"But O
she O
would O
soon O
find O
some O
one O
else O
to O
take O
my O
place?" O
"Ce O
n'est O
pas O
ca, O
ce O
n'est O
pas O
ca," O
again O
interrupted O
De O
Griers. O
"Que O
diable! O
Do O
not O
leave O
her O
alone O
so O
much O
as O
advise O
her, O
persuade O
her, O
draw O
her O
away. O
In O
any O
case O
do O
not O
let O
her O
gamble; O
find O
her O
some O
counter-attraction." O
"And O
how O
am O
I O
to O
do O
that? O
If O
only O
you O
would O
undertake O
the O
task, O
Monsieur O
de O
Griers!" O
I O
said O
this O
last O
as O
innocently O
as O
possible, O
but O
at O
once O
saw O
a O
rapid O
glance O
of O
excited O
interrogation O
pass O
from O
Mlle. O
Blanche O
to O
De O
Griers, O
while O
in O
the O
face O
of O
the O
latter O
also O
there O
gleamed O
something O
which O
he O
could O
not O
repress. O
"Well, O
at O
the O
present O
moment O
she O
would O
refuse O
to O
accept O
my O
services," O
said O
he O
with O
a O
gesture. O
"But O
if, O
later--" O
Here O
he O
gave O
Mlle. O
Blanche O
another O
glance O
which O
was O
full O
of O
meaning; O
whereupon O
she O
advanced O
towards O
me O
with O
a O
bewitching O
smile, O
and O
seized O
and O
pressed O
my O
hands. O
Devil O
take O
it, O
but O
how O
that O
devilish O
visage O
of O
hers O
could O
change! O
At O
the O
present O
moment O
it O
was O
a O
visage O
full O
of O
supplication, O
and O
as O
gentle O
in O
its O
expression O
as O
that O
of O
a O
smiling, O
roguish O
infant. O
Stealthily, O
she O
drew O
me O
apart O
from O
the O
rest O
as O
though O
the O
more O
completely O
to O
separate O
me O
from O
them; O
and, O
though O
no O
harm O
came O
of O
her O
doing O
so--for O
it O
was O
merely O
a O
stupid O
manoeuvre, O
and O
no O
more--I O
found O
the O
situation O
very O
unpleasant. O
The O
General O
hastened O
to O
lend O
her O
his O
support. O
"Alexis O
Ivanovitch," O
he O
began, O
"pray O
pardon O
me O
for O
having O
said O
what O
I O
did O
just O
now--for O
having O
said O
more O
than O
I O
meant O
to O
do. O
I O
beg O
and O
beseech O
you, O
I O
kiss O
the O
hem O
of O
your O
garment, O
as O
our O
Russian O
saying O
has O
it, O
for O
you, O
and O
only O
you, O
can O
save O
us. O
I O
and O
Mlle. O
de O
Cominges, O
we O
all O
of O
us O
beg O
of O
you--But O
you O
understand, O
do O
you O
not? O
Surely O
you O
understand?" O
and O
with O
his O
eyes O
he O
indicated O
Mlle. O
Blanche. O
Truly O
he O
was O
cutting O
a O
pitiful O
figure! O
At O
this O
moment O
three O
low, O
respectful O
knocks O
sounded O
at O
the O
door; O
which, O
on O
being O
opened, O
revealed O
a O
chambermaid, O
with O
Potapitch PERSON
behind O
her--come O
from O
the O
Grandmother O
to O
request O
that O
I O
should O
attend O
her O
in O
her O
rooms. O
"She O
is O
in O
a O
bad O
humour," O
added O
Potapitch. O
The O
time O
was O
half-past O
three. O
"My O
mistress O
was O
unable O
to O
sleep," O
explained O
Potapitch; O
"so, O
after O
tossing O
about O
for O
a O
while, O
she O
suddenly O
rose, O
called O
for O
her O
chair, O
and O
sent O
me O
to O
look O
for O
you. O
She O
is O
now O
in O
the O
verandah." O
"Quelle O
megere!" O
exclaimed O
De O
Griers. O
True O
enough, O
I O
found O
Madame O
in O
the O
hotel O
verandah--much O
put O
about O
at O
my O
delay, O
for O
she O
had O
been O
unable O
to O
contain O
herself O
until O
four O
o'clock. O
"Lift O
me O
up," O
she O
cried O
to O
the O
bearers, O
and O
once O
more O
we O
set O
out O
for O
the O
roulette-salons. O
XII O
The O
Grandmother O
was O
in O
an O
impatient, O
irritable O
frame O
of O
mind. O
Without O
doubt O
the O
roulette O
had O
turned O
her O
head, O
for O
she O
appeared O
to O
be O
indifferent O
to O
everything O
else, O
and, O
in O
general, O
seemed O
much O
distraught. O
For O
instance, O
she O
asked O
me O
no O
questions O
about O
objects O
en O
route, O
except O
that, O
when O
a O
sumptuous O
barouche O
passed O
us O
and O
raised O
a O
cloud O
of O
dust, O
she O
lifted O
her O
hand O
for O
a O
moment, O
and O
inquired, O
"What O
was O
that?" O
Yet O
even O
then O
she O
did O
not O
appear O
to O
hear O
my O
reply, O
although O
at O
times O
her O
abstraction O
was O
interrupted O
by O
sallies O
and O
fits O
of O
sharp, O
impatient O
fidgeting. O
Again, O
when O
I O
pointed O
out O
to O
her O
the O
Baron O
and O
Baroness PERSON
Burmergelm PERSON
walking O
to O
the O
Casino, O
she O
merely O
looked O
at O
them O
in O
an O
absent-minded O
sort O
of O
way, O
and O
said O
with O
complete O
indifference, O
"Ah!" O
Then, O
turning O
sharply O
to O
Potapitch LOCATION
and O
Martha, O
who O
were O
walking O
behind O
us, O
she O
rapped O
out: O
"Why O
have O
YOU O
attached O
yourselves O
to O
the O
party? O
We O
are O
not O
going O
to O
take O
you O
with O
us O
every O
time. O
Go O
home O
at O
once." O
Then, O
when O
the O
servants O
had O
pulled O
hasty O
bows O
and O
departed, O
she O
added O
to O
me: O
"You O
are O
all O
the O
escort O
I O
need." O
At O
the O
Casino O
the O
Grandmother O
seemed O
to O
be O
expected, O
for O
no O
time O
was O
lost O
in O
procuring O
her O
former O
place O
beside O
the O
croupier. O
It O
is O
my O
opinion O
that O
though O
croupiers O
seem O
such O
ordinary, O
humdrum O
officials--men O
who O
care O
nothing O
whether O
the O
bank O
wins O
or O
loses--they O
are, O
in O
reality, O
anything O
but O
indifferent O
to O
the O
bank's O
losing, O
and O
are O
given O
instructions O
to O
attract O
players, O
and O
to O
keep O
a O
watch O
over O
the O
bank's O
interests; O
as O
also, O
that O
for O
such O
services, O
these O
officials O
are O
awarded O
prizes O
and O
premiums. O
At O
all O
events, O
the O
croupiers O
of O
Roulettenberg LOCATION
seemed O
to O
look O
upon O
the O
Grandmother O
as O
their O
lawful O
prey--whereafter O
there O
befell O
what O
our O
party O
had O
foretold. O
It O
happened O
thus: O
As O
soon O
as O
ever O
we O
arrived O
the O
Grandmother O
ordered O
me O
to O
stake O
twelve O
ten-gulden O
pieces O
in O
succession O
upon O
zero. O
Once, O
twice, O
and O
thrice O
I O
did O
so, O
yet O
zero O
never O
turned O
up. O
"Stake O
again," O
said O
the O
old O
lady O
with O
an O
impatient O
nudge O
of O
my O
elbow, O
and O
I O
obeyed. O
"How O
many O
times O
have O
we O
lost?" O
she O
inquired--actually O
grinding O
her O
teeth O
in O
her O
excitement. O
"We O
have O
lost O
144 O
ten-gulden O
pieces," O
I O
replied. O
"I O
tell O
you, O
Madame, O
that O
zero O
may O
not O
turn O
up O
until O
nightfall." O
"Never O
mind," O
she O
interrupted. O
"Keep O
on O
staking O
upon O
zero, O
and O
also O
stake O
a O
thousand O
gulden O
upon O
rouge. O
Here O
is O
a O
banknote O
with O
which O
to O
do O
so." O
The O
red O
turned O
up, O
but O
zero O
missed O
again, O
and O
we O
only O
got O
our O
thousand O
gulden O
back. O
"But O
you O
see, O
you O
see," O
whispered O
the O
old O
lady. O
"We O
have O
now O
recovered O
almost O
all O
that O
we O
staked. O
Try O
zero O
again. O
Let O
us O
do O
so O
another O
ten O
times, O
and O
then O
leave O
off." O
By O
the O
fifth O
round, O
however, O
the O
Grandmother O
was O
weary O
of O
the O
scheme. O
"To O
the O
devil O
with O
that O
zero!" O
she O
exclaimed. O
"Stake O
four O
thousand O
gulden O
upon O
the O
red." O
"But, O
Madame, O
that O
will O
be O
so O
much O
to O
venture!" O
I O
remonstrated. O
"Suppose O
the O
red O
should O
not O
turn O
up?" O
The O
Grandmother O
almost O
struck O
me O
in O
her O
excitement. O
Her O
agitation O
was O
rapidly O
making O
her O
quarrelsome. O
Consequently, O
there O
was O
nothing O
for O
it O
but O
to O
stake O
the O
whole O
four O
thousand O
gulden O
as O
she O
had O
directed. O
The O
wheel O
revolved O
while O
the O
Grandmother O
sat O
as O
bolt O
upright, O
and O
with O
as O
proud O
and O
quiet O
a O
mien, O
as O
though O
she O
had O
not O
the O
least O
doubt O
of O
winning. O
"Zero!" O
cried O
the O
croupier. O
At O
first O
the O
old O
lady O
failed O
to O
understand O
the O
situation; O
but, O
as O
soon O
as O
she O
saw O
the O
croupier O
raking O
in O
her O
four O
thousand O
gulden, O
together O
with O
everything O
else O
that O
happened O
to O
be O
lying O
on O
the O
table, O
and O
recognised O
that O
the O
zero O
which O
had O
been O
so O
long O
turning O
up, O
and O
on O
which O
we O
had O
lost O
nearly O
two O
hundred O
ten-gulden O
pieces, O
had O
at O
length, O
as O
though O
of O
set O
purpose, O
made O
a O
sudden O
reappearance--why, O
the O
poor O
old O
lady O
fell O
to O
cursing O
it, O
and O
to O
throwing O
herself O
about, O
and O
wailing O
and O
gesticulating O
at O
the O
company O
at O
large. O
Indeed, O
some O
people O
in O
our O
vicinity O
actually O
burst O
out O
laughing. O
"To O
think O
that O
that O
accursed O
zero O
should O
have O
turned O
up O
NOW!" O
she O
sobbed. O
"The O
accursed, O
accursed O
thing! O
And, O
it O
is O
all O
YOUR O
fault," O
she O
added, O
rounding O
upon O
me O
in O
a O
frenzy. O
"It O
was O
you O
who O
persuaded O
me O
to O
cease O
staking O
upon O
it." O
"But, O
Madame, O
I O
only O
explained O
the O
game O
to O
you. O
How O
am O
I O
to O
answer O
for O
every O
mischance O
which O
may O
occur O
in O
it?" O
"You O
and O
your O
mischances!" O
she O
whispered O
threateningly. O
"Go! O
Away O
at O
once!" O
"Farewell, O
then, O
Madame." O
And O
I O
turned O
to O
depart. O
"No--stay," O
she O
put O
in O
hastily. O
"Where O
are O
you O
going O
to? O
Why O
should O
you O
leave O
me? O
You O
fool! O
No, O
no... O
stay O
here. O
It O
is O
I O
who O
was O
the O
fool. O
Tell O
me O
what O
I O
ought O
to O
do." O
"I O
cannot O
take O
it O
upon O
myself O
to O
advise O
you, O
for O
you O
will O
only O
blame O
me O
if O
I O
do O
so. O
Play O
at O
your O
own O
discretion. O
Say O
exactly O
what O
you O
wish O
staked, O
and O
I O
will O
stake O
it." O
"Very O
well. O
Stake O
another O
four O
thousand O
gulden O
upon O
the O
red. O
Take O
this O
banknote O
to O
do O
it O
with. O
I O
have O
still O
got O
twenty O
thousand O
roubles O
in O
actual O
cash." O
"But," O
I O
whispered, O
"such O
a O
quantity O
of O
money--" O
"Never O
mind. O
I O
cannot O
rest O
until O
I O
have O
won O
back O
my O
losses. O
Stake!" O
I O
staked, O
and O
we O
lost. O
"Stake O
again, O
stake O
again--eight O
thousand O
at O
a O
stroke!" O
"I O
cannot, O
Madame. O
The O
largest O
stake O
allowed O
is O
four O
thousand O
gulden." O
"Well, O
then; O
stake O
four O
thousand." O
This O
time O
we O
won, O
and O
the O
Grandmother O
recovered O
herself O
a O
little. O
"You O
see, O
you O
see!" O
she O
exclaimed O
as O
she O
nudged O
me. O
"Stake O
another O
four O
thousand." O
I O
did O
so, O
and O
lost. O
Again, O
and O
yet O
again, O
we O
lost. O
"Madame, O
your O
twelve O
thousand O
gulden O
are O
now O
gone," O
at O
length O
I O
reported. O
"I O
see O
they O
are," O
she O
replied O
with, O
as O
it O
were, O
the O
calmness O
of O
despair. O
"I O
see O
they O
are," O
she O
muttered O
again O
as O
she O
gazed O
straight O
in O
front O
of O
her, O
like O
a O
person O
lost O
in O
thought. O
"Ah O
well, O
I O
do O
not O
mean O
to O
rest O
until O
I O
have O
staked O
another O
four O
thousand." O
"But O
you O
have O
no O
money O
with O
which O
to O
do O
it, O
Madame. O
In O
this O
satchel O
I O
can O
see O
only O
a O
few O
five O
percent O
bonds O
and O
some O
transfers--no O
actual O
cash." O
"And O
in O
the O
purse?" O
"A O
mere O
trifle." O
"But O
there O
is O
a O
money-changer's O
office O
here, O
is O
there O
not? O
They O
told O
me O
I O
should O
be O
able O
to O
get O
any O
sort O
of O
paper O
security O
changed!" O
"Quite O
so; O
to O
any O
amount O
you O
please. O
But O
you O
will O
lose O
on O
the O
transaction O
what O
would O
frighten O
even O
a O
Jew." O
"Rubbish! O
I O
am O
DETERMINED O
to O
retrieve O
my O
losses. O
Take O
me O
away, O
and O
call O
those O
fools O
of O
bearers." O
I O
wheeled O
the O
chair O
out O
of O
the O
throng, O
and, O
the O
bearers O
making O
their O
appearance, O
we O
left O
the O
Casino. O
"Hurry, O
hurry!" O
commanded O
the O
Grandmother. O
"Show O
me O
the O
nearest O
way O
to O
the O
money-changer's. O
Is O
it O
far?" O
"A O
couple O
of O
steps, O
Madame." O
At O
the O
turning O
from O
the O
square O
into O
the O
Avenue O
we O
came O
face O
to O
face O
with O
the O
whole O
of O
our O
party--the O
General, O
De O
Griers, O
Mlle. O
Blanche, O
and O
her O
mother. O
Only O
Polina PERSON
and O
Mr. O
Astley PERSON
were O
absent. O
"Well, O
well, O
well!" O
exclaimed O
the O
Grandmother. O
"But O
we O
have O
no O
time O
to O
stop. O
What O
do O
you O
want? O
I O
can't O
talk O
to O
you O
here." O
I O
dropped O
behind O
a O
little, O
and O
immediately O
was O
pounced O
upon O
by O
De O
Griers. O
"She O
has O
lost O
this O
morning's O
winnings," O
I O
whispered, O
"and O
also O
twelve O
thousand O
gulden O
of O
her O
original O
money. O
At O
the O
present O
moment O
we O
are O
going O
to O
get O
some O
bonds O
changed." O
De PERSON
Griers PERSON
stamped O
his O
foot O
with O
vexation, O
and O
hastened O
to O
communicate O
the O
tidings O
to O
the O
General. O
Meanwhile O
we O
continued O
to O
wheel O
the O
old O
lady O
along. O
"Stop O
her, O
stop O
her," O
whispered O
the O
General O
in O
consternation. O
"You O
had O
better O
try O
and O
stop O
her O
yourself," O
I O
returned--also O
in O
a O
whisper. O
"My O
good O
mother," O
he O
said O
as O
he O
approached O
her, O
"--my O
good O
mother, O
pray O
let, O
let--" O
(his O
voice O
was O
beginning O
to O
tremble O
and O
sink) O
"--let O
us O
hire O
a O
carriage, O
and O
go O
for O
a O
drive. O
Near O
here O
there O
is O
an O
enchanting O
view O
to O
be O
obtained. O
We-we-we O
were O
just O
coming O
to O
invite O
you O
to O
go O
and O
see O
it." O
"Begone O
with O
you O
and O
your O
views!" O
said O
the O
Grandmother O
angrily O
as O
she O
waved O
him O
away. O
"And O
there O
are O
trees O
there, O
and O
we O
could O
have O
tea O
under O
them," O
continued O
the O
General--now O
in O
utter O
despair. O
"Nous O
boirons O
du O
lait, O
sur O
l'herbe O
fraiche," O
added O
De PERSON
Griers PERSON
with O
the O
snarl O
almost O
of O
a O
wild O
beast. O
"Du O
lait, O
de O
l'herbe O
fraiche"--the O
idyll, O
the O
ideal O
of O
the O
Parisian O
bourgeois--his O
whole O
outlook O
upon O
"la O
nature O
et O
la O
verite"! O
"Have O
done O
with O
you O
and O
your O
milk!" O
cried O
the O
old O
lady. O
"Go O
and O
stuff O
YOURSELF O
as O
much O
as O
you O
like, O
but O
my O
stomach O
simply O
recoils O
from O
the O
idea. O
What O
are O
you O
stopping O
for? O
I O
have O
nothing O
to O
say O
to O
you." O
"Here O
we O
are, O
Madame," O
I O
announced. O
"Here O
is O
the O
moneychanger's O
office." O
I O
entered O
to O
get O
the O
securities O
changed, O
while O
the O
Grandmother O
remained O
outside O
in O
the O
porch, O
and O
the O
rest O
waited O
at O
a O
little O
distance, O
in O
doubt O
as O
to O
their O
best O
course O
of O
action. O
At O
length O
the O
old O
lady O
turned O
such O
an O
angry O
stare O
upon O
them O
that O
they O
departed O
along O
the O
road O
towards O
the O
Casino. O
The O
process O
of O
changing O
involved O
complicated O
calculations O
which O
soon O
necessitated O
my O
return O
to O
the O
Grandmother O
for O
instructions. O
"The O
thieves!" O
she O
exclaimed O
as O
she O
clapped O
her O
hands O
together. O
"Never O
mind, O
though. O
Get O
the O
documents O
cashed--No; O
send O
the O
banker O
out O
to O
me," O
she O
added O
as O
an O
afterthought. O
"Would O
one O
of O
the O
clerks O
do, O
Madame?" O
"Yes, O
one O
of O
the O
clerks. O
The O
thieves!" O
The O
clerk O
consented O
to O
come O
out O
when O
he O
perceived O
that O
he O
was O
being O
asked O
for O
by O
an O
old O
lady O
who O
was O
too O
infirm O
to O
walk; O
after O
which O
the O
Grandmother O
began O
to O
upbraid O
him O
at O
length, O
and O
with O
great O
vehemence, O
for O
his O
alleged O
usuriousness, O
and O
to O
bargain O
with O
him O
in O
a O
mixture O
of O
Russian, O
French, O
and O
German--I O
acting O
as O
interpreter. O
Meanwhile, O
the O
grave-faced O
official O
eyed O
us O
both, O
and O
silently O
nodded O
his O
head. O
At O
the O
Grandmother, O
in O
particular, O
he O
gazed O
with O
a O
curiosity O
which O
almost O
bordered O
upon O
rudeness. O
At O
length, O
too, O
he O
smiled. O
"Pray O
recollect O
yourself!" O
cried O
the O
old O
lady. O
"And O
may O
my O
money O
choke O
you! O
Alexis PERSON
Ivanovitch, O
tell O
him O
that O
we O
can O
easily O
repair O
to O
someone O
else." O
"The O
clerk O
says O
that O
others O
will O
give O
you O
even O
less O
than O
he." O
Of O
what O
the O
ultimate O
calculations O
consisted O
I O
do O
not O
exactly O
remember, O
but O
at O
all O
events O
they O
were O
alarming. O
Receiving O
twelve O
thousand O
florins O
in O
gold, O
I O
took O
also O
the O
statement O
of O
accounts, O
and O
carried O
it O
out O
to O
the O
Grandmother. O
"Well, O
well," O
she O
said, O
"I O
am O
no O
accountant. O
Let O
us O
hurry O
away, O
hurry O
away." O
And O
she O
waved O
the O
paper O
aside. O
"Neither O
upon O
that O
accursed O
zero, O
however, O
nor O
upon O
that O
equally O
accursed O
red O
do O
I O
mean O
to O
stake O
a O
cent," O
I O
muttered O
to O
myself O
as O
I O
entered O
the O
Casino. O
This O
time O
I O
did O
all O
I O
could O
to O
persuade O
the O
old O
lady O
to O
stake O
as O
little O
as O
possible--saying O
that O
a O
turn O
would O
come O
in O
the O
chances O
when O
she O
would O
be O
at O
liberty O
to O
stake O
more. O
But O
she O
was O
so O
impatient O
that, O
though O
at O
first O
she O
agreed O
to O
do O
as O
I O
suggested, O
nothing O
could O
stop O
her O
when O
once O
she O
had O
begun. O
By O
way O
of O
prelude O
she O
won O
stakes O
of O
a O
hundred O
and O
two O
hundred O
gulden. O
"There O
you O
are!" O
she O
said O
as O
she O
nudged O
me. O
"See O
what O
we O
have O
won! O
Surely O
it O
would O
be O
worth O
our O
while O
to O
stake O
four O
thousand O
instead O
of O
a O
hundred, O
for O
we O
might O
win O
another O
four O
thousand, O
and O
then--! O
Oh, O
it O
was O
YOUR O
fault O
before--all O
your O
fault!" O
I O
felt O
greatly O
put O
out O
as O
I O
watched O
her O
play, O
but O
I O
decided O
to O
hold O
my O
tongue, O
and O
to O
give O
her O
no O
more O
advice. O
Suddenly O
De PERSON
Griers PERSON
appeared O
on O
the O
scene. O
It O
seemed O
that O
all O
this O
while O
he O
and O
his O
companions O
had O
been O
standing O
beside O
us--though O
I O
noticed O
that O
Mlle. O
Blanche O
had O
withdrawn O
a O
little O
from O
the O
rest, O
and O
was O
engaged O
in O
flirting O
with O
the O
Prince. O
Clearly O
the O
General O
was O
greatly O
put O
out O
at O
this. O
Indeed, O
he O
was O
in O
a O
perfect O
agony O
of O
vexation. O
But O
Mlle. O
was O
careful O
never O
to O
look O
his O
way, O
though O
he O
did O
his O
best O
to O
attract O
her O
notice. O
Poor O
General! O
By O
turns O
his O
face O
blanched O
and O
reddened, O
and O
he O
was O
trembling O
to O
such O
an O
extent O
that O
he O
could O
scarcely O
follow O
the O
old O
lady's O
play. O
At O
length O
Mlle. O
and O
the O
Prince PERSON
took O
their O
departure, O
and O
the O
General O
followed O
them. O
"Madame, O
Madame," O
sounded O
the O
honeyed O
accents O
of O
De PERSON
Griers PERSON
as O
he O
leant O
over O
to O
whisper O
in O
the O
Grandmother's O
ear. O
"That O
stake O
will O
never O
win. O
No, O
no, O
it O
is O
impossible," O
he O
added O
in O
Russian O
with O
a O
writhe. O
"No, O
no!" O
"But O
why O
not?" O
asked O
the O
Grandmother, O
turning O
round. O
"Show O
me O
what O
I O
ought O
to O
do." O
Instantly O
De PERSON
Griers PERSON
burst O
into O
a O
babble O
of O
French O
as O
he O
advised, O
jumped O
about, O
declared O
that O
such O
and O
such O
chances O
ought O
to O
be O
waited O
for, O
and O
started O
to O
make O
calculations O
of O
figures. O
All O
this O
he O
addressed O
to O
me O
in O
my O
capacity O
as O
translator--tapping O
the O
table O
the O
while O
with O
his O
finger, O
and O
pointing O
hither O
and O
thither. O
At O
length O
he O
seized O
a O
pencil, O
and O
began O
to O
reckon O
sums O
on O
paper O
until O
he O
had O
exhausted O
the O
Grandmother's O
patience. O
"Away O
with O
you!" O
she O
interrupted. O
"You O
talk O
sheer O
nonsense, O
for, O
though O
you O
keep O
on O
saying O
'Madame, O
Madame,' O
you O
haven't O
the O
least O
notion O
what O
ought O
to O
be O
done. O
Away O
with O
you, O
I O
say!" O
"Mais, O
Madame," O
cooed O
De O
Griers--and O
straightway O
started O
afresh O
with O
his O
fussy O
instructions. O
"Stake O
just O
ONCE, O
as O
he O
advises," O
the O
Grandmother O
said O
to O
me, O
"and O
then O
we O
shall O
see O
what O
we O
shall O
see. O
Of O
course, O
his O
stake O
MIGHT O
win." O
As O
a O
matter O
of O
fact, O
De O
Grier's O
one O
object O
was O
to O
distract O
the O
old O
lady O
from O
staking O
large O
sums; O
wherefore, O
he O
now O
suggested O
to O
her O
that O
she O
should O
stake O
upon O
certain O
numbers, O
singly O
and O
in O
groups. O
Consequently, O
in O
accordance O
with O
his O
instructions, O
I O
staked O
a O
ten-gulden O
piece O
upon O
several O
odd O
numbers O
in O
the O
first O
twenty, O
and O
five O
ten-gulden O
pieces O
upon O
certain O
groups O
of O
numbers-groups O
of O
from O
twelve O
to O
eighteen, O
and O
from O
eighteen O
to O
twenty-four. O
The O
total O
staked O
amounted O
to O
160 O
gulden. O
The O
wheel O
revolved. O
"Zero!" O
cried O
the O
croupier. O
We O
had O
lost O
it O
all! O
"The O
fool!" O
cried O
the O
old O
lady O
as O
she O
turned O
upon O
De O
Griers. O
"You O
infernal O
Frenchman, O
to O
think O
that O
you O
should O
advise! O
Away O
with O
you! O
Though O
you O
fuss O
and O
fuss, O
you O
don't O
even O
know O
what O
you're O
talking O
about." O
Deeply O
offended, O
De PERSON
Griers PERSON
shrugged O
his O
shoulders, O
favoured O
the O
Grandmother O
with O
a O
look O
of O
contempt, O
and O
departed. O
For O
some O
time O
past O
he O
had O
been O
feeling O
ashamed O
of O
being O
seen O
in O
such O
company, O
and O
this O
had O
proved O
the O
last O
straw. O
An O
hour O
later O
we O
had O
lost O
everything O
in O
hand. O
"Home!" O
cried O
the O
Grandmother. O
Not O
until O
we O
had O
turned O
into O
the O
Avenue O
did O
she O
utter O
a O
word; O
but O
from O
that O
point O
onwards, O
until O
we O
arrived O
at O
the O
hotel, O
she O
kept O
venting O
exclamations O
of O
"What O
a O
fool O
I O
am! O
What O
a O
silly O
old O
fool O
I O
am, O
to O
be O
sure!" O
Arrived O
at O
the O
hotel, O
she O
called O
for O
tea, O
and O
then O
gave O
orders O
for O
her O
luggage O
to O
be O
packed. O
"We O
are O
off O
again," O
she O
announced. O
"But O
whither, O
Madame?" O
inquired O
Martha. O
"What O
business O
is O
that O
of O
YOURS? O
Let O
the O
cricket O
stick O
to O
its O
hearth. O
[The O
Russian O
form O
of O
"Mind O
your O
own O
business."] O
Potapitch, O
have O
everything O
packed, O
for O
we O
are O
returning O
to O
Moscow LOCATION
at O
once. O
I O
have O
fooled O
away O
fifteen O
thousand O
roubles." O
"Fifteen O
thousand O
roubles, O
good O
mistress? O
My O
God!" O
And O
Potapitch PERSON
spat O
upon O
his O
hands--probably O
to O
show O
that O
he O
was O
ready O
to O
serve O
her O
in O
any O
way O
he O
could. O
"Now O
then, O
you O
fool! O
At O
once O
you O
begin O
with O
your O
weeping O
and O
wailing! O
Be O
quiet, O
and O
pack. O
Also, O
run O
downstairs, O
and O
get O
my O
hotel O
bill." O
"The O
next O
train O
leaves O
at O
9:30, O
Madame," O
I O
interposed, O
with O
a O
view O
to O
checking O
her O
agitation. O
"And O
what O
is O
the O
time O
now?" O
"Half-past O
eight." O
"How O
vexing! O
But, O
never O
mind. O
Alexis PERSON
Ivanovitch, O
I O
have O
not O
a O
kopeck O
left; O
I O
have O
but O
these O
two O
bank O
notes. O
Please O
run O
to O
the O
office O
and O
get O
them O
changed. O
Otherwise O
I O
shall O
have O
nothing O
to O
travel O
with." O
Departing O
on O
her O
errand, O
I O
returned O
half O
an O
hour O
later O
to O
find O
the O
whole O
party O
gathered O
in O
her O
rooms. O
It O
appeared O
that O
the O
news O
of O
her O
impending O
departure O
for O
Moscow LOCATION
had O
thrown O
the O
conspirators O
into O
consternation O
even O
greater O
than O
her O
losses O
had O
done. O
For, O
said O
they, O
even O
if O
her O
departure O
should O
save O
her O
fortune, O
what O
will O
become O
of O
the O
General O
later? O
And O
who O
is O
to O
repay O
De O
Griers? O
Clearly O
Mlle. O
Blanche PERSON
would O
never O
consent O
to O
wait O
until O
the O
Grandmother O
was O
dead, O
but O
would O
at O
once O
elope O
with O
the O
Prince O
or O
someone O
else. O
So O
they O
had O
all O
gathered O
together--endeavouring O
to O
calm O
and O
dissuade O
the O
Grandmother. O
Only O
Polina PERSON
was O
absent. O
For O
her O
part O
the O
Grandmother O
had O
nothing O
for O
the O
party O
but O
abuse. O
"Away O
with O
you, O
you O
rascals!" O
she O
was O
shouting. O
"What O
have O
my O
affairs O
to O
do O
with O
you? O
Why, O
in O
particular, O
do O
you"--here O
she O
indicated O
De O
Griers--"come O
sneaking O
here O
with O
your O
goat's O
beard? O
And O
what O
do O
YOU"--here O
she O
turned O
to O
Mlle. O
Blanche O
"want O
of O
me? O
What O
are O
YOU O
finicking O
for?" O
"Diantre!" O
muttered O
Mlle. O
under O
her O
breath, O
but O
her O
eyes O
were O
flashing. O
Then O
all O
at O
once O
she O
burst O
into O
a O
laugh O
and O
left O
the O
room--crying O
to O
the O
General O
as O
she O
did O
so: O
"Elle O
vivra O
cent O
ans!" O
"So O
you O
have O
been O
counting O
upon O
my O
death, O
have O
you?" O
fumed O
the O
old O
lady. O
"Away O
with O
you! O
Clear O
them O
out O
of O
the O
room, O
Alexis PERSON
Ivanovitch. O
What O
business O
is O
it O
of O
THEIRS? O
It O
is O
not O
THEIR O
money O
that O
I O
have O
been O
squandering, O
but O
my O
own." O
The O
General O
shrugged O
his O
shoulders, O
bowed, O
and O
withdrew, O
with O
De PERSON
Griers PERSON
behind O
him. O
"Call O
Prascovia," O
commanded O
the O
Grandmother, O
and O
in O
five O
minutes O
Martha PERSON
reappeared O
with O
Polina, O
who O
had O
been O
sitting O
with O
the O
children O
in O
her O
own O
room O
(having O
purposely O
determined O
not O
to O
leave O
it O
that O
day). O
Her O
face O
looked O
grave O
and O
careworn. O
"Prascovia," O
began O
the O
Grandmother, O
"is O
what O
I O
have O
just O
heard O
through O
a O
side O
wind O
true--namely, O
that O
this O
fool O
of O
a O
stepfather O
of O
yours O
is O
going O
to O
marry O
that O
silly O
whirligig O
of O
a O
Frenchwoman--that O
actress, O
or O
something O
worse? O
Tell O
me, O
is O
it O
true?" O
"I O
do O
not O
know O
FOR O
CERTAIN, O
Grandmamma," O
replied O
Polina; O
"but O
from O
Mlle. O
Blanche's O
account O
(for O
she O
does O
not O
appear O
to O
think O
it O
necessary O
to O
conceal O
anything) O
I O
conclude O
that--" O
"You O
need O
not O
say O
any O
more," O
interrupted O
the O
Grandmother O
energetically. O
"I O
understand O
the O
situation. O
I O
always O
thought O
we O
should O
get O
something O
like O
this O
from O
him, O
for O
I O
always O
looked O
upon O
him O
as O
a O
futile, O
frivolous O
fellow O
who O
gave O
himself O
unconscionable O
airs O
on O
the O
fact O
of O
his O
being O
a O
general O
(though O
he O
only O
became O
one O
because O
he O
retired O
as O
a O
colonel). O
Yes, O
I O
know O
all O
about O
the O
sending O
of O
the O
telegrams O
to O
inquire O
whether O
'the O
old O
woman O
is O
likely O
to O
turn O
up O
her O
toes O
soon.' O
Ah, O
they O
were O
looking O
for O
the O
legacies! O
Without O
money O
that O
wretched O
woman O
(what O
is O
her O
name?--Oh, O
De O
Cominges) O
would O
never O
dream O
of O
accepting O
the O
General O
and O
his O
false O
teeth--no, O
not O
even O
for O
him O
to O
be O
her O
lacquey--since O
she O
herself, O
they O
say, O
possesses O
a O
pile O
of O
money, O
and O
lends O
it O
on O
interest, O
and O
makes O
a O
good O
thing O
out O
of O
it. O
However, O
it O
is O
not O
you, O
Prascovia, O
that O
I O
am O
blaming; O
it O
was O
not O
you O
who O
sent O
those O
telegrams. O
Nor, O
for O
that O
matter, O
do O
I O
wish O
to O
recall O
old O
scores. O
True, O
I O
know O
that O
you O
are O
a O
vixen O
by O
nature--that O
you O
are O
a O
wasp O
which O
will O
sting O
one O
if O
one O
touches O
it--yet, O
my O
heart O
is O
sore O
for O
you, O
for O
I O
loved O
your O
mother, O
Katerina. O
Now, O
will O
you O
leave O
everything O
here, O
and O
come O
away O
with O
me? O
Otherwise, O
I O
do O
not O
know O
what O
is O
to O
become O
of O
you, O
and O
it O
is O
not O
right O
that O
you O
should O
continue O
living O
with O
these O
people. O
Nay," O
she O
interposed, O
the O
moment O
that O
Polina PERSON
attempted O
to O
speak, O
"I O
have O
not O
yet O
finished. O
I O
ask O
of O
you O
nothing O
in O
return. O
My O
house O
in O
Moscow LOCATION
is, O
as O
you O
know, O
large O
enough O
for O
a O
palace, O
and O
you O
could O
occupy O
a O
whole O
floor O
of O
it O
if O
you O
liked, O
and O
keep O
away O
from O
me O
for O
weeks O
together. O
Will O
you O
come O
with O
me O
or O
will O
you O
not?" O
"First O
of O
all, O
let O
me O
ask O
of O
YOU," O
replied O
Polina, O
"whether O
you O
are O
intending O
to O
depart O
at O
once?" O
"What? O
You O
suppose O
me O
to O
be O
jesting? O
I O
have O
said O
that O
I O
am O
going, O
and O
I O
AM O
going. O
Today O
I O
have O
squandered O
fifteen O
thousand O
roubles O
at O
that O
accursed O
roulette O
of O
yours, O
and O
though, O
five O
years O
ago, O
I O
promised O
the O
people O
of O
a O
certain O
suburb O
of O
Moscow LOCATION
to O
build O
them O
a O
stone O
church O
in O
place O
of O
a O
wooden O
one, O
I O
have O
been O
fooling O
away O
my O
money O
here! O
However, O
I O
am O
going O
back O
now O
to O
build O
my O
church." O
"But O
what O
about O
the O
waters, O
Grandmamma? O
Surely O
you O
came O
here O
to O
take O
the O
waters?" O
"You O
and O
your O
waters! O
Do O
not O
anger O
me, O
Prascovia. O
Surely O
you O
are O
trying O
to? O
Say, O
then: O
will O
you, O
or O
will O
you O
not, O
come O
with O
me?" O
"Grandmamma," O
Polina PERSON
replied O
with O
deep O
feeling, O
"I O
am O
very, O
very O
grateful O
to O
you O
for O
the O
shelter O
which O
you O
have O
so O
kindly O
offered O
me. O
Also, O
to O
a O
certain O
extent O
you O
have O
guessed O
my O
position O
aright, O
and O
I O
am O
beholden O
to O
you O
to O
such O
an O
extent O
that O
it O
may O
be O
that O
I O
will O
come O
and O
live O
with O
you, O
and O
that O
very O
soon; O
yet O
there O
are O
important O
reasons O
why--why O
I O
cannot O
make O
up O
my O
mind O
just O
yet. O
If O
you O
would O
let O
me O
have, O
say, O
a O
couple O
of O
weeks O
to O
decide O
in--?" O
"You O
mean O
that O
you O
are O
NOT O
coming?" O
"I O
mean O
only O
that O
I O
cannot O
come O
just O
yet. O
At O
all O
events, O
I O
could O
not O
well O
leave O
my O
little O
brother O
and O
sister O
here, O
since, O
since--if O
I O
were O
to O
leave O
them--they O
would O
be O
abandoned O
altogether. O
But O
if, O
Grandmamma, O
you O
would O
take O
the O
little O
ones O
AND O
myself, O
then, O
of O
course, O
I O
could O
come O
with O
you, O
and O
would O
do O
all O
I O
could O
to O
serve O
you" O
(this O
she O
said O
with O
great O
earnestness). O
"Only, O
without O
the O
little O
ones O
I O
CANNOT O
come." O
"Do O
not O
make O
a O
fuss" O
(as O
a O
matter O
of O
fact O
Polina PERSON
never O
at O
any O
time O
either O
fussed O
or O
wept). O
"The O
Great O
Foster--Father O
[Translated O
literally--The O
Great O
Poulterer] O
can O
find O
for O
all O
his O
chicks O
a O
place. O
You O
are O
not O
coming O
without O
the O
children? O
But O
see O
here, O
Prascovia. O
I O
wish O
you O
well, O
and O
nothing O
but O
well: O
yet O
I O
have O
divined O
the O
reason O
why O
you O
will O
not O
come. O
Yes, O
I O
know O
all, O
Prascovia. O
That O
Frenchman O
will O
never O
bring O
you O
good O
of O
any O
sort." O
Polina PERSON
coloured O
hotly, O
and O
even O
I O
started. O
"For," O
thought O
I O
to O
myself, O
"every O
one O
seems O
to O
know O
about O
that O
affair. O
Or O
perhaps O
I O
am O
the O
only O
one O
who O
does O
not O
know O
about O
it?" O
"Now, O
now! O
Do O
not O
frown," O
continued O
the O
Grandmother. O
"But O
I O
do O
not O
intend O
to O
slur O
things O
over. O
You O
will O
take O
care O
that O
no O
harm O
befalls O
you, O
will O
you O
not? O
For O
you O
are O
a O
girl O
of O
sense, O
and O
I O
am O
sorry O
for O
you--I O
regard O
you O
in O
a O
different O
light O
to O
the O
rest O
of O
them. O
And O
now, O
please, O
leave O
me. O
Good-bye." O
"But O
let O
me O
stay O
with O
you O
a O
little O
longer," O
said O
Polina. O
"No," O
replied O
the O
other; O
"you O
need O
not. O
Do O
not O
bother O
me, O
for O
you O
and O
all O
of O
them O
have O
tired O
me O
out." O
Yet O
when O
Polina PERSON
tried O
to O
kiss O
the O
Grandmother's O
hand, O
the O
old O
lady O
withdrew O
it, O
and O
herself O
kissed O
the O
girl O
on O
the O
cheek. O
As O
she O
passed O
me, O
Polina PERSON
gave O
me O
a O
momentary O
glance, O
and O
then O
as O
swiftly O
averted O
her O
eyes. O
"And O
good-bye O
to O
you, O
also, O
Alexis PERSON
Ivanovitch. O
The O
train O
starts O
in O
an O
hour's O
time, O
and O
I O
think O
that O
you O
must O
be O
weary O
of O
me. O
Take O
these O
five O
hundred O
gulden O
for O
yourself." O
"I O
thank O
you O
humbly, O
Madame, O
but O
I O
am O
ashamed O
to--" O
"Come, O
come!" O
cried O
the O
Grandmother O
so O
energetically, O
and O
with O
such O
an O
air O
of O
menace, O
that O
I O
did O
not O
dare O
refuse O
the O
money O
further. O
"If, O
when O
in O
Moscow, O
you O
have O
no O
place O
where O
you O
can O
lay O
your O
head," O
she O
added, O
"come O
and O
see O
me, O
and O
I O
will O
give O
you O
a O
recommendation. O
Now, O
Potapitch, O
get O
things O
ready." O
I O
ascended O
to O
my O
room, O
and O
lay O
down O
upon O
the O
bed. O
A O
whole O
hour O
I O
must O
have O
lain O
thus, O
with O
my O
head O
resting O
upon O
my O
hand. O
So O
the O
crisis O
had O
come! O
I O
needed O
time O
for O
its O
consideration. O
To-morrow O
I O
would O
have O
a O
talk O
with O
Polina. O
Ah! O
The O
Frenchman! O
So, O
it O
was O
true? O
But O
how O
could O
it O
be O
so? O
Polina PERSON
and O
De O
Griers! O
What O
a O
combination! O
No, O
it O
was O
too O
improbable. O
Suddenly O
I O
leapt O
up O
with O
the O
idea O
of O
seeking O
Astley PERSON
and O
forcing O
him O
to O
speak. O
There O
could O
be O
no O
doubt O
that O
he O
knew O
more O
than O
I O
did. O
Astley? O
Well, O
he O
was O
another O
problem O
for O
me O
to O
solve. O
Suddenly O
there O
came O
a O
knock O
at O
the O
door, O
and O
I O
opened O
it O
to O
find O
Potapitch O
awaiting O
me. O
"Sir," O
he O
said, O
"my O
mistress O
is O
asking O
for O
you." O
"Indeed? O
But O
she O
is O
just O
departing, O
is O
she O
not? O
The O
train O
leaves O
in O
ten O
minutes' O
time." O
"She O
is O
uneasy, O
sir; O
she O
cannot O
rest. O
Come O
quickly, O
sir; O
do O
not O
delay." O
I O
ran O
downstairs O
at O
once. O
The O
Grandmother O
was O
just O
being O
carried O
out O
of O
her O
rooms O
into O
the O
corridor. O
In O
her O
hands O
she O
held O
a O
roll O
of O
bank-notes. O
"Alexis O
Ivanovitch," O
she O
cried, O
"walk O
on O
ahead, O
and O
we O
will O
set O
out O
again." O
"But O
whither, O
Madame?" O
"I O
cannot O
rest O
until O
I O
have O
retrieved O
my O
losses. O
March O
on O
ahead, O
and O
ask O
me O
no O
questions. O
Play O
continues O
until O
midnight, O
does O
it O
not?" O
For O
a O
moment O
I O
stood O
stupefied--stood O
deep O
in O
thought; O
but O
it O
was O
not O
long O
before O
I O
had O
made O
up O
my O
mind. O
"With O
your O
leave, O
Madame," O
I O
said, O
"I O
will O
not O
go O
with O
you." O
"And O
why O
not? O
What O
do O
you O
mean? O
Is O
every O
one O
here O
a O
stupid O
good-for-nothing?" O
"Pardon O
me, O
but O
I O
have O
nothing O
to O
reproach O
myself O
with. O
I O
merely O
will O
not O
go. O
I O
merely O
intend O
neither O
to O
witness O
nor O
to O
join O
in O
your O
play. O
I O
also O
beg O
to O
return O
you O
your O
five O
hundred O
gulden. O
Farewell." O
Laying O
the O
money O
upon O
a O
little O
table O
which O
the O
Grandmother's O
chair O
happened O
to O
be O
passing, O
I O
bowed O
and O
withdrew. O
"What O
folly!" O
the O
Grandmother O
shouted O
after O
me. O
"Very O
well, O
then. O
Do O
not O
come, O
and O
I O
will O
find O
my O
way O
alone. O
Potapitch, O
you O
must O
come O
with O
me. O
Lift O
up O
the O
chair, O
and O
carry O
me O
along." O
I O
failed O
to O
find O
Mr. O
Astley, O
and O
returned O
home. O
It O
was O
now O
growing O
late--it O
was O
past O
midnight, O
but O
I O
subsequently O
learnt O
from O
Potapitch O
how O
the O
Grandmother's O
day O
had O
ended. O
She O
had O
lost O
all O
the O
money O
which, O
earlier O
in O
the O
day, O
I O
had O
got O
for O
her O
paper O
securities--a O
sum O
amounting O
to O
about O
ten O
thousand O
roubles. O
This O
she O
did O
under O
the O
direction O
of O
the O
Pole O
whom, O
that O
afternoon, O
she O
had O
dowered O
with O
two O
ten-gulden O
pieces. O
But O
before O
his O
arrival O
on O
the O
scene, O
she O
had O
commanded O
Potapitch PERSON
to O
stake O
for O
her; O
until O
at O
length O
she O
had O
told O
him O
also O
to O
go O
about O
his O
business. O
Upon O
that O
the O
Pole O
had O
leapt O
into O
the O
breach. O
Not O
only O
did O
it O
happen O
that O
he O
knew O
the O
Russian O
language, O
but O
also O
he O
could O
speak O
a O
mixture O
of O
three O
different O
dialects, O
so O
that O
the O
pair O
were O
able O
to O
understand O
one O
another. O
Yet O
the O
old O
lady O
never O
ceased O
to O
abuse O
him, O
despite O
his O
deferential O
manner, O
and O
to O
compare O
him O
unfavourably O
with O
myself O
(so, O
at O
all O
events, O
Potapitch O
declared). O
"You," O
the O
old O
chamberlain O
said O
to O
me, O
"treated O
her O
as O
a O
gentleman O
should, O
but O
he--he O
robbed O
her O
right O
and O
left, O
as O
I O
could O
see O
with O
my O
own O
eyes. O
Twice O
she O
caught O
him O
at O
it, O
and O
rated O
him O
soundly. O
On O
one O
occasion O
she O
even O
pulled O
his O
hair, O
so O
that O
the O
bystanders O
burst O
out O
laughing. O
Yet O
she O
lost O
everything, O
sir--that O
is O
to O
say, O
she O
lost O
all O
that O
you O
had O
changed O
for O
her. O
Then O
we O
brought O
her O
home, O
and, O
after O
asking O
for O
some O
water O
and O
saying O
her O
prayers, O
she O
went O
to O
bed. O
So O
worn O
out O
was O
she O
that O
she O
fell O
asleep O
at O
once. O
May O
God O
send O
her O
dreams O
of O
angels! O
And O
this O
is O
all O
that O
foreign O
travel O
has O
done O
for O
us! O
Oh, O
my O
own O
Moscow! O
For O
what O
have O
we O
not O
at O
home O
there, O
in O
Moscow? O
Such O
a O
garden O
and O
flowers O
as O
you O
could O
never O
see O
here, O
and O
fresh O
air O
and O
apple-trees O
coming O
into O
blossom,--and O
a O
beautiful O
view O
to O
look O
upon. O
Ah, O
but O
what O
must O
she O
do O
but O
go O
travelling O
abroad? O
Alack, O
alack!" O
XIII O
Almost O
a O
month O
has O
passed O
since O
I O
last O
touched O
these O
notes--notes O
which O
I O
began O
under O
the O
influence O
of O
impressions O
at O
once O
poignant O
and O
disordered. O
The O
crisis O
which O
I O
then O
felt O
to O
be O
approaching O
has O
now O
arrived, O
but O
in O
a O
form O
a O
hundred O
times O
more O
extensive O
and O
unexpected O
than O
I O
had O
looked O
for. O
To O
me O
it O
all O
seems O
strange, O
uncouth, O
and O
tragic. O
Certain O
occurrences O
have O
befallen O
me O
which O
border O
upon O
the O
marvellous. O
At O
all O
events, O
that O
is O
how O
I O
view O
them. O
I O
view O
them O
so O
in O
one O
regard O
at O
least. O
I O
refer O
to O
the O
whirlpool O
of O
events O
in O
which, O
at O
the O
time, O
I O
was O
revolving. O
But O
the O
most O
curious O
feature O
of O
all O
is O
my O
relation O
to O
those O
events, O
for O
hitherto O
I O
had O
never O
clearly O
understood O
myself. O
Yet O
now O
the O
actual O
crisis O
has O
passed O
away O
like O
a O
dream. O
Even O
my O
passion O
for O
Polina PERSON
is O
dead. O
Was O
it O
ever O
so O
strong O
and O
genuine O
as O
I O
thought? O
If O
so, O
what O
has O
become O
of O
it O
now? O
At O
times O
I O
fancy O
that O
I O
must O
be O
mad; O
that O
somewhere O
I O
am O
sitting O
in O
a O
madhouse; O
that O
these O
events O
have O
merely O
SEEMED O
to O
happen; O
that O
still O
they O
merely O
SEEM O
to O
be O
happening. O
I O
have O
been O
arranging O
and O
re-perusing O
my O
notes O
(perhaps O
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
convincing O
myself O
that O
I O
am O
not O
in O
a O
madhouse). O
At O
present O
I O
am O
lonely O
and O
alone. O
Autumn O
is O
coming--already O
it O
is O
mellowing O
the O
leaves; O
and, O
as O
I O
sit O
brooding O
in O
this O
melancholy O
little O
town O
(and O
how O
melancholy O
the O
little O
towns O
of O
Germany LOCATION
can O
be!), O
I O
find O
myself O
taking O
no O
thought O
for O
the O
future, O
but O
living O
under O
the O
influence O
of O
passing O
moods, O
and O
of O
my O
recollections O
of O
the O
tempest O
which O
recently O
drew O
me O
into O
its O
vortex, O
and O
then O
cast O
me O
out O
again. O
At O
times O
I O
seem O
still O
to O
be O
caught O
within O
that O
vortex. O
At O
times, O
the O
tempest O
seems O
once O
more O
to O
be O
gathering, O
and, O
as O
it O
passes O
overhead, O
to O
be O
wrapping O
me O
in O
its O
folds, O
until O
I O
have O
lost O
my O
sense O
of O
order O
and O
reality, O
and O
continue O
whirling O
and O
whirling O
and O
whirling O
around. O
Yet, O
it O
may O
be O
that O
I O
shall O
be O
able O
to O
stop O
myself O
from O
revolving O
if O
once O
I O
can O
succeed O
in O
rendering O
myself O
an O
exact O
account O
of O
what O
has O
happened O
within O
the O
month O
just O
past. O
Somehow O
I O
feel O
drawn O
towards O
the O
pen; O
on O
many O
and O
many O
an O
evening O
I O
have O
had O
nothing O
else O
in O
the O
world O
to O
do. O
But, O
curiously O
enough, O
of O
late O
I O
have O
taken O
to O
amusing O
myself O
with O
the O
works O
of O
M. PERSON
Paul PERSON
de O
Kock, O
which O
I O
read O
in O
German O
translations O
obtained O
from O
a O
wretched O
local O
library. O
These O
works O
I O
cannot O
abide, O
yet O
I O
read O
them, O
and O
find O
myself O
marvelling O
that O
I O
should O
be O
doing O
so. O
Somehow O
I O
seem O
to O
be O
afraid O
of O
any O
SERIOUS O
book--afraid O
of O
permitting O
any O
SERIOUS O
preoccupation O
to O
break O
the O
spell O
of O
the O
passing O
moment. O
So O
dear O
to O
me O
is O
the O
formless O
dream O
of O
which O
I O
have O
spoken, O
so O
dear O
to O
me O
are O
the O
impressions O
which O
it O
has O
left O
behind O
it, O
that O
I O
fear O
to O
touch O
the O
vision O
with O
anything O
new, O
lest O
it O
should O
dissolve O
in O
smoke. O
But O
is O
it O
so O
dear O
to O
me? O
Yes, O
it O
IS O
dear O
to O
me, O
and O
will O
ever O
be O
fresh O
in O
my O
recollections--even O
forty O
years O
hence.... O
So O
let O
me O
write O
of O
it, O
but O
only O
partially, O
and O
in O
a O
more O
abridged O
form O
than O
my O
full O
impressions O
might O
warrant. O
First O
of O
all, O
let O
me O
conclude O
the O
history O
of O
the O
Grandmother. O
Next O
day O
she O
lost O
every O
gulden O
that O
she O
possessed. O
Things O
were O
bound O
to O
happen O
so, O
for O
persons O
of O
her O
type O
who O
have O
once O
entered O
upon O
that O
road O
descend O
it O
with O
ever-increasing O
rapidity, O
even O
as O
a O
sledge O
descends O
a O
toboggan-slide. O
All O
day O
until O
eight O
o'clock O
that O
evening O
did O
she O
play; O
and, O
though O
I O
personally O
did O
not O
witness O
her O
exploits, O
I O
learnt O
of O
them O
later O
through O
report. O
All O
that O
day O
Potapitch PERSON
remained O
in O
attendance O
upon O
her; O
but O
the O
Poles O
who O
directed O
her O
play O
she O
changed O
more O
than O
once. O
As O
a O
beginning O
she O
dismissed O
her O
Pole O
of O
the O
previous O
day--the O
Pole O
whose O
hair O
she O
had O
pulled--and O
took O
to O
herself O
another O
one; O
but O
the O
latter O
proved O
worse O
even O
than O
the O
former, O
and O
incurred O
dismissal O
in O
favour O
of O
the O
first O
Pole, O
who, O
during O
the O
time O
of O
his O
unemployment, O
had O
nevertheless O
hovered O
around O
the O
Grandmother's O
chair, O
and O
from O
time O
to O
time O
obtruded O
his O
head O
over O
her O
shoulder. O
At O
length O
the O
old O
lady O
became O
desperate, O
for O
the O
second O
Pole, O
when O
dismissed, O
imitated O
his O
predecessor O
by O
declining O
to O
go O
away; O
with O
the O
result O
that O
one O
Pole O
remained O
standing O
on O
the O
right O
of O
the O
victim, O
and O
the O
other O
on O
her O
left; O
from O
which O
vantage O
points O
the O
pair O
quarrelled, O
abused O
each O
other O
concerning O
the O
stakes O
and O
rounds, O
and O
exchanged O
the O
epithet O
"laidak" O
[Rascal] O
and O
other O
Polish O
terms O
of O
endearment. O
Finally, O
they O
effected O
a O
mutual O
reconciliation, O
and, O
tossing O
the O
money O
about O
anyhow, O
played O
simply O
at O
random. O
Once O
more O
quarrelling, O
each O
of O
them O
staked O
money O
on O
his O
own O
side O
of O
the O
Grandmother's O
chair O
(for O
instance, O
the O
one O
Pole O
staked O
upon O
the O
red, O
and O
the O
other O
one O
upon O
the O
black), O
until O
they O
had O
so O
confused O
and O
browbeaten O
the O
old O
lady O
that, O
nearly O
weeping, O
she O
was O
forced O
to O
appeal O
to O
the O
head O
croupier O
for O
protection, O
and O
to O
have O
the O
two O
Poles O
expelled. O
No O
time O
was O
lost O
in O
this O
being O
done, O
despite O
the O
rascals' O
cries O
and O
protestations O
that O
the O
old O
lady O
was O
in O
their O
debt, O
that O
she O
had O
cheated O
them, O
and O
that O
her O
general O
behaviour O
had O
been O
mean O
and O
dishonourable. O
The O
same O
evening O
the O
unfortunate O
Potapitch O
related O
the O
story O
to O
me O
with O
tears O
complaining O
that O
the O
two O
men O
had O
filled O
their O
pockets O
with O
money O
(he O
himself O
had O
seen O
them O
do O
it) O
which O
had O
been O
shamelessly O
pilfered O
from O
his O
mistress. O
For O
instance, O
one O
Pole O
demanded O
of O
the O
Grandmother O
fifty O
gulden O
for O
his O
trouble, O
and O
then O
staked O
the O
money O
by O
the O
side O
of O
her O
stake. O
She O
happened O
to O
win; O
whereupon O
he O
cried O
out O
that O
the O
winning O
stake O
was O
his, O
and O
hers O
the O
loser. O
As O
soon O
as O
the O
two O
Poles O
had O
been O
expelled, O
Potapitch PERSON
left O
the O
room, O
and O
reported O
to O
the O
authorities O
that O
the O
men's O
pockets O
were O
full O
of O
gold; O
and, O
on O
the O
Grandmother O
also O
requesting O
the O
head O
croupier O
to O
look O
into O
the O
affair, O
the O
police O
made O
their O
appearance, O
and, O
despite O
the O
protests O
of O
the O
Poles O
(who, O
indeed, O
had O
been O
caught O
redhanded), O
their O
pockets O
were O
turned O
inside O
out, O
and O
the O
contents O
handed O
over O
to O
the O
Grandmother. O
In O
fact, O
in, O
view O
of O
the O
circumstance O
that O
she O
lost O
all O
day, O
the O
croupiers O
and O
other O
authorities O
of O
the O
Casino O
showed O
her O
every O
attention; O
and O
on O
her O
fame O
spreading O
through O
the O
town, O
visitors O
of O
every O
nationality--even O
the O
most O
knowing O
of O
them, O
the O
most O
distinguished--crowded O
to O
get O
a O
glimpse O
of O
"la O
vieille O
comtesse O
russe, O
tombee O
en O
enfance," O
who O
had O
lost O
"so O
many O
millions." O
Yet O
with O
the O
money O
which O
the O
authorities O
restored O
to O
her O
from O
the O
pockets O
of O
the O
Poles O
the O
Grandmother O
effected O
very, O
very O
little, O
for O
there O
soon O
arrived O
to O
take O
his O
countrymen's O
place, O
a O
third O
Pole--a O
man O
who O
could O
speak O
Russian O
fluently, O
was O
dressed O
like O
a O
gentleman O
(albeit O
in O
lacqueyish O
fashion), O
and O
sported O
a O
huge O
moustache. O
Though O
polite O
enough O
to O
the O
old O
lady, O
he O
took O
a O
high O
hand O
with O
the O
bystanders. O
In O
short, O
he O
offered O
himself O
less O
as O
a O
servant O
than O
as O
an O
ENTERTAINER. O
After O
each O
round O
he O
would O
turn O
to O
the O
old O
lady, O
and O
swear O
terrible O
oaths O
to O
the O
effect O
that O
he O
was O
a O
"Polish O
gentleman O
of O
honour" O
who O
would O
scorn O
to O
take O
a O
kopeck O
of O
her O
money; O
and, O
though O
he O
repeated O
these O
oaths O
so O
often O
that O
at O
length O
she O
grew O
alarmed, O
he O
had O
her O
play O
in O
hand, O
and O
began O
to O
win O
on O
her O
behalf; O
wherefore, O
she O
felt O
that O
she O
could O
not O
well O
get O
rid O
of O
him. O
An O
hour O
later O
the O
two O
Poles O
who, O
earlier O
in O
the O
day, O
had O
been O
expelled O
from O
the O
Casino, O
made O
a O
reappearance O
behind O
the O
old O
lady's O
chair, O
and O
renewed O
their O
offers O
of O
service--even O
if O
it O
were O
only O
to O
be O
sent O
on O
messages; O
but O
from O
Potapitch LOCATION
I O
subsequently O
had O
it O
that O
between O
these O
rascals O
and O
the O
said O
"gentleman O
of O
honour" O
there O
passed O
a O
wink, O
as O
well O
as O
that O
the O
latter O
put O
something O
into O
their O
hands. O
Next, O
since O
the O
Grandmother O
had O
not O
yet O
lunched--she O
had O
scarcely O
for O
a O
moment O
left O
her O
chair--one O
of O
the O
two O
Poles O
ran O
to O
the O
restaurant O
of O
the O
Casino, O
and O
brought O
her O
thence O
a O
cup O
of O
soup, O
and O
afterwards O
some O
tea. O
In O
fact, O
BOTH O
the O
Poles O
hastened O
to O
perform O
this O
office. O
Finally, O
towards O
the O
close O
of O
the O
day, O
when O
it O
was O
clear O
that O
the O
Grandmother PERSON
was O
about O
to O
play O
her O
last O
bank-note, O
there O
could O
be O
seen O
standing O
behind O
her O
chair O
no O
fewer O
than O
six O
natives O
of O
Poland--persons O
who, O
as O
yet, O
had O
been O
neither O
audible O
nor O
visible; O
and O
as O
soon O
as O
ever O
the O
old O
lady O
played O
the O
note O
in O
question, O
they O
took O
no O
further O
notice O
of O
her, O
but O
pushed O
their O
way O
past O
her O
chair O
to O
the O
table; O
seized O
the O
money, O
and O
staked O
it--shouting O
and O
disputing O
the O
while, O
and O
arguing O
with O
the O
"gentleman O
of O
honour" O
(who O
also O
had O
forgotten O
the O
Grandmother's O
existence), O
as O
though O
he O
were O
their O
equal. O
Even O
when O
the O
Grandmother O
had O
lost O
her O
all, O
and O
was O
returning O
(about O
eight O
o'clock) O
to O
the O
hotel, O
some O
three O
or O
four O
Poles O
could O
not O
bring O
themselves O
to O
leave O
her, O
but O
went O
on O
running O
beside O
her O
chair O
and O
volubly O
protesting O
that O
the O
Grandmother O
had O
cheated O
them, O
and O
that O
she O
ought O
to O
be O
made O
to O
surrender O
what O
was O
not O
her O
own. O
Thus O
the O
party O
arrived O
at O
the O
hotel; O
whence, O
presently, O
the O
gang O
of O
rascals O
was O
ejected O
neck O
and O
crop. O
According O
to O
Potapitch's O
calculations, O
the O
Grandmother O
lost, O
that O
day, O
a O
total O
of O
ninety O
thousand O
roubles, O
in O
addition O
to O
the O
money O
which O
she O
had O
lost O
the O
day O
before. O
Every O
paper O
security O
which O
she O
had O
brought O
with O
her--five O
percent O
bonds, O
internal O
loan O
scrip, O
and O
what O
not--she O
had O
changed O
into O
cash. O
Also, O
I O
could O
not O
but O
marvel O
at O
the O
way O
in O
which, O
for O
seven O
or O
eight O
hours O
at O
a O
stretch, O
she O
sat O
in O
that O
chair O
of O
hers, O
almost O
never O
leaving O
the O
table. O
Again, O
Potapitch PERSON
told O
me O
that O
there O
were O
three O
occasions O
on O
which O
she O
really O
began O
to O
win; O
but O
that, O
led O
on O
by O
false O
hopes, O
she O
was O
unable O
to O
tear O
herself O
away O
at O
the O
right O
moment. O
Every O
gambler O
knows O
how O
a O
person O
may O
sit O
a O
day O
and O
a O
night O
at O
cards O
without O
ever O
casting O
a O
glance O
to O
right O
or O
to O
left. O
Meanwhile, O
that O
day O
some O
other O
very O
important O
events O
were O
passing O
in O
our O
hotel. O
As O
early O
as O
eleven O
o'clock--that O
is O
to O
say, O
before O
the O
Grandmother O
had O
quitted O
her O
rooms--the O
General O
and O
De PERSON
Griers PERSON
decided O
upon O
their O
last O
stroke. O
In O
other O
words, O
on O
learning O
that O
the O
old O
lady O
had O
changed O
her O
mind O
about O
departing, O
and O
was O
bent O
on O
setting O
out O
for O
the O
Casino O
again, O
the O
whole O
of O
our O
gang O
(Polina O
only O
excepted) O
proceeded O
en O
masse O
to O
her O
rooms, O
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
finally O
and O
frankly O
treating O
with O
her. O
But O
the O
General, O
quaking O
and O
greatly O
apprehensive O
as O
to O
his O
possible O
future, O
overdid O
things. O
After O
half O
an O
hour's O
prayers O
and O
entreaties, O
coupled O
with O
a O
full O
confession O
of O
his O
debts, O
and O
even O
of O
his O
passion O
for O
Mlle. O
Blanche O
(yes, O
he O
had O
quite O
lost O
his O
head), O
he O
suddenly O
adopted O
a O
tone O
of O
menace, O
and O
started O
to O
rage O
at O
the O
old O
lady--exclaiming O
that O
she O
was O
sullying O
the O
family O
honour, O
that O
she O
was O
making O
a O
public O
scandal O
of O
herself, O
and O
that O
she O
was O
smirching O
the O
fair O
name O
of O
Russia. O
The O
upshot O
was O
that O
the O
Grandmother O
turned O
him O
out O
of O
the O
room O
with O
her O
stick O
(it O
was O
a O
real O
stick, O
too!). O
Later O
in O
the O
morning O
he O
held O
several O
consultations O
with O
De O
Griers--the O
question O
which O
occupied O
him O
being: O
Is O
it O
in O
any O
way O
possible O
to O
make O
use O
of O
the O
police--to O
tell O
them O
that O
"this O
respected, O
but O
unfortunate, O
old O
lady O
has O
gone O
out O
of O
her O
mind, O
and O
is O
squandering O
her O
last O
kopeck," O
or O
something O
of O
the O
kind? O
In O
short, O
is O
it O
in O
any O
way O
possible O
to O
engineer O
a O
species O
of O
supervision O
over, O
or O
of O
restraint O
upon, O
the O
old O
lady? O
De O
Griers, O
however, O
shrugged O
his O
shoulders O
at O
this, O
and O
laughed O
in O
the O
General's O
face, O
while O
the O
old O
warrior O
went O
on O
chattering O
volubly, O
and O
running O
up O
and O
down O
his O
study. O
Finally O
De PERSON
Griers PERSON
waved O
his O
hand, O
and O
disappeared O
from O
view; O
and O
by O
evening O
it O
became O
known O
that O
he O
had O
left O
the O
hotel, O
after O
holding O
a O
very O
secret O
and O
important O
conference O
with O
Mlle. O
Blanche. O
As O
for O
the O
latter, O
from O
early O
morning O
she O
had O
taken O
decisive O
measures, O
by O
completely O
excluding O
the O
General O
from O
her O
presence, O
and O
bestowing O
upon O
him O
not O
a O
glance. O
Indeed, O
even O
when O
the O
General O
pursued O
her O
to O
the O
Casino, O
and O
met O
her O
walking O
arm O
in O
arm O
with O
the O
Prince, O
he O
(the O
General) O
received O
from O
her O
and O
her O
mother O
not O
the O
slightest O
recognition. O
Nor O
did O
the O
Prince O
himself O
bow. O
The O
rest O
of O
the O
day O
Mlle. O
spent O
in O
probing O
the O
Prince, O
and O
trying O
to O
make O
him O
declare O
himself; O
but O
in O
this O
she O
made O
a O
woeful O
mistake. O
The O
little O
incident O
occurred O
in O
the O
evening. O
Suddenly O
Mlle. O
Blanche O
realised O
that O
the O
Prince O
had O
not O
even O
a O
copper O
to O
his O
name, O
but, O
on O
the O
contrary, O
was O
minded O
to O
borrow O
of O
her O
money O
wherewith O
to O
play O
at O
roulette. O
In O
high O
displeasure O
she O
drove O
him O
from O
her O
presence, O
and O
shut O
herself O
up O
in O
her O
room. O
The O
same O
morning O
I O
went O
to O
see--or, O
rather, O
to O
look O
for--Mr. O
Astley, O
but O
was O
unsuccessful O
in O
my O
quest. O
Neither O
in O
his O
rooms O
nor O
in O
the O
Casino O
nor O
in O
the O
Park O
was O
he O
to O
be O
found; O
nor O
did O
he, O
that O
day, O
lunch O
at O
his O
hotel O
as O
usual. O
However, O
at O
about O
five O
o'clock O
I O
caught O
sight O
of O
him O
walking O
from O
the O
railway O
station O
to O
the O
Hotel O
d'Angleterre. O
He O
seemed O
to O
be O
in O
a O
great O
hurry O
and O
much O
preoccupied, O
though O
in O
his O
face O
I O
could O
discern O
no O
actual O
traces O
of O
worry O
or O
perturbation. O
He O
held O
out O
to O
me O
a O
friendly O
hand, O
with O
his O
usual O
ejaculation O
of O
"Ah!" O
but O
did O
not O
check O
his O
stride. O
I O
turned O
and O
walked O
beside O
him, O
but O
found, O
somehow, O
that O
his O
answers O
forbade O
any O
putting O
of O
definite O
questions. O
Moreover, O
I O
felt O
reluctant O
to O
speak O
to O
him O
of O
Polina; O
nor, O
for O
his O
part, O
did O
he O
ask O
me O
any O
questions O
concerning O
her, O
although, O
on O
my O
telling O
him O
of O
the O
Grandmother's O
exploits, O
he O
listened O
attentively O
and O
gravely, O
and O
then O
shrugged O
his O
shoulders. O
"She O
is O
gambling O
away O
everything O
that O
she O
has," O
I O
remarked. O
"Indeed? O
She O
arrived O
at O
the O
Casino O
even O
before O
I O
had O
taken O
my O
departure O
by O
train, O
so O
I O
knew O
she O
had O
been O
playing. O
If O
I O
should O
have O
time O
I O
will O
go O
to O
the O
Casino O
to-night, O
and O
take O
a O
look O
at O
her. O
The O
thing O
interests O
me." O
"Where O
have O
you O
been O
today?" O
I O
asked--surprised O
at O
myself O
for O
having, O
as O
yet, O
omitted O
to O
put O
to O
him O
that O
question. O
"To O
Frankfort." O
"On O
business?" O
"On O
business." O
What O
more O
was O
there O
to O
be O
asked O
after O
that? O
I O
accompanied O
him O
until, O
as O
we O
drew O
level O
with O
the O
Hotel O
des O
Quatre O
Saisons, O
he O
suddenly O
nodded O
to O
me O
and O
disappeared. O
For O
myself, O
I O
returned O
home, O
and O
came O
to O
the O
conclusion O
that, O
even O
had O
I O
met O
him O
at O
two O
o'clock O
in O
the O
afternoon, O
I O
should O
have O
learnt O
no O
more O
from O
him O
than O
I O
had O
done O
at O
five O
o'clock, O
for O
the O
reason O
that O
I O
had O
no O
definite O
question O
to O
ask. O
It O
was O
bound O
to O
have O
been O
so. O
For O
me O
to O
formulate O
the O
query O
which O
I O
really O
wished O
to O
put O
was O
a O
simple O
impossibility. O
Polina PERSON
spent O
the O
whole O
of O
that O
day O
either O
in O
walking O
about O
the O
park O
with O
the O
nurse O
and O
children O
or O
in O
sitting O
in O
her O
own O
room. O
For O
a O
long O
while O
past O
she O
had O
avoided O
the O
General O
and O
had O
scarcely O
had O
a O
word O
to O
say O
to O
him O
(scarcely O
a O
word, O
I O
mean, O
on O
any O
SERIOUS O
topic). O
Yes, O
that O
I O
had O
noticed. O
Still, O
even O
though O
I O
was O
aware O
of O
the O
position O
in O
which O
the O
General O
was O
placed, O
it O
had O
never O
occurred O
to O
me O
that O
he O
would O
have O
any O
reason O
to O
avoid O
HER, O
or O
to O
trouble O
her O
with O
family O
explanations. O
Indeed, O
when O
I O
was O
returning O
to O
the O
hotel O
after O
my O
conversation O
with O
Astley, O
and O
chanced O
to O
meet O
Polina PERSON
and O
the O
children, O
I O
could O
see O
that O
her O
face O
was O
as O
calm O
as O
though O
the O
family O
disturbances O
had O
never O
touched O
her. O
To O
my O
salute O
she O
responded O
with O
a O
slight O
bow, O
and O
I O
retired O
to O
my O
room O
in O
a O
very O
bad O
humour. O
Of O
course, O
since O
the O
affair O
with O
the O
Burmergelms O
I O
had O
exchanged O
not O
a O
word O
with O
Polina, O
nor O
had O
with O
her O
any O
kind O
of O
intercourse. O
Yet O
I O
had O
been O
at O
my O
wits' O
end, O
for, O
as O
time O
went O
on, O
there O
was O
arising O
in O
me O
an O
ever-seething O
dissatisfaction. O
Even O
if O
she O
did O
not O
love O
me O
she O
ought O
not O
to O
have O
trampled O
upon O
my O
feelings, O
nor O
to O
have O
accepted O
my O
confessions O
with O
such O
contempt, O
seeing O
that O
she O
must O
have O
been O
aware O
that O
I O
loved O
her O
(of O
her O
own O
accord O
she O
had O
allowed O
me O
to O
tell O
her O
as O
much). O
Of O
course O
the O
situation O
between O
us O
had O
arisen O
in O
a O
curious O
manner. O
About O
two O
months O
ago, O
I O
had O
noticed O
that O
she O
had O
a O
desire O
to O
make O
me O
her O
friend, O
her O
confidant--that O
she O
was O
making O
trial O
of O
me O
for O
the O
purpose; O
but, O
for O
some O
reason O
or O
another, O
the O
desired O
result O
had O
never O
come O
about, O
and O
we O
had O
fallen O
into O
the O
present O
strange O
relations, O
which O
had O
led O
me O
to O
address O
her O
as O
I O
had O
done. O
At O
the O
same O
time, O
if O
my O
love O
was O
distasteful O
to O
her, O
why O
had O
she O
not O
FORBIDDEN O
me O
to O
speak O
of O
it O
to O
her? O
But O
she O
had O
not O
so O
forbidden O
me. O
On O
the O
contrary, O
there O
had O
been O
occasions O
when O
she O
had O
even O
INVITED O
me O
to O
speak. O
Of O
course, O
this O
might O
have O
been O
done O
out O
of O
sheer O
wantonness, O
for O
I O
well O
knew--I O
had O
remarked O
it O
only O
too O
often--that, O
after O
listening O
to O
what O
I O
had O
to O
say, O
and O
angering O
me O
almost O
beyond O
endurance, O
she O
loved O
suddenly O
to O
torture O
me O
with O
some O
fresh O
outburst O
of O
contempt O
and O
aloofness! O
Yet O
she O
must O
have O
known O
that O
I O
could O
not O
live O
without O
her. O
Three O
days O
had O
elapsed O
since O
the O
affair O
with O
the O
Baron, O
and O
I O
could O
bear O
the O
severance O
no O
longer. O
When, O
that O
afternoon, O
I O
met O
her O
near O
the O
Casino, O
my O
heart O
almost O
made O
me O
faint, O
it O
beat O
so O
violently. O
She O
too O
could O
not O
live O
without O
me, O
for O
had O
she O
not O
said O
that O
she O
had O
NEED O
of O
me? O
Or O
had O
that O
too O
been O
spoken O
in O
jest? O
That O
she O
had O
a O
secret O
of O
some O
kind O
there O
could O
be O
no O
doubt. O
What O
she O
had O
said O
to O
the O
Grandmother O
had O
stabbed O
me O
to O
the O
heart. O
On O
a O
thousand O
occasions O
I O
had O
challenged O
her O
to O
be O
open O
with O
me, O
nor O
could O
she O
have O
been O
ignorant O
that O
I O
was O
ready O
to O
give O
my O
very O
life O
for O
her. O
Yet O
always O
she O
had O
kept O
me O
at O
a O
distance O
with O
that O
contemptuous O
air O
of O
hers; O
or O
else O
she O
had O
demanded O
of O
me, O
in O
lieu O
of O
the O
life O
which O
I O
offered O
to O
lay O
at O
her O
feet, O
such O
escapades O
as O
I O
had O
perpetrated O
with O
the O
Baron. O
Ah, O
was O
it O
not O
torture O
to O
me, O
all O
this? O
For O
could O
it O
be O
that O
her O
whole O
world O
was O
bound O
up O
with O
the O
Frenchman? O
What, O
too, O
about O
Mr. O
Astley? O
The O
affair O
was O
inexplicable O
throughout. O
My O
God, O
what O
distress O
it O
caused O
me! O
Arrived O
home, O
I, O
in O
a O
fit O
of O
frenzy, O
indited O
the O
following: O
"Polina O
Alexandrovna, O
I O
can O
see O
that O
there O
is O
approaching O
us O
an O
exposure O
which O
will O
involve O
you O
too. O
For O
the O
last O
time O
I O
ask O
of O
you--have O
you, O
or O
have O
you O
not, O
any O
need O
of O
my O
life? O
If O
you O
have, O
then O
make O
such O
dispositions O
as O
you O
wish, O
and O
I O
shall O
always O
be O
discoverable O
in O
my O
room O
if O
required. O
If O
you O
have O
need O
of O
my O
life, O
write O
or O
send O
for O
me." O
I O
sealed O
the O
letter, O
and O
dispatched O
it O
by O
the O
hand O
of O
a O
corridor O
lacquey, O
with O
orders O
to O
hand O
it O
to O
the O
addressee O
in O
person. O
Though O
I O
expected O
no O
answer, O
scarcely O
three O
minutes O
had O
elapsed O
before O
the O
lacquey O
returned O
with O
"the O
compliments O
of O
a O
certain O
person." O
Next, O
about O
seven O
o'clock, O
I O
was O
sent O
for O
by O
the O
General. O
I O
found O
him O
in O
his O
study, O
apparently O
preparing O
to O
go O
out O
again, O
for O
his O
hat O
and O
stick O
were O
lying O
on O
the O
sofa. O
When O
I O
entered O
he O
was O
standing O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
room--his O
feet O
wide O
apart, O
and O
his O
head O
bent O
down. O
Also, O
he O
appeared O
to O
be O
talking O
to O
himself. O
But O
as O
soon O
as O
ever O
he O
saw O
me O
at O
the O
door O
he O
came O
towards O
me O
in O
such O
a O
curious O
manner O
that O
involuntarily O
I O
retreated O
a O
step, O
and O
was O
for O
leaving O
the O
room; O
whereupon O
he O
seized O
me O
by O
both O
hands, O
and, O
drawing O
me O
towards O
the O
sofa, O
and O
seating O
himself O
thereon, O
he O
forced O
me O
to O
sit O
down O
on O
a O
chair O
opposite O
him. O
Then, O
without O
letting O
go O
of O
my O
hands, O
he O
exclaimed O
with O
quivering O
lips O
and O
a O
sparkle O
of O
tears O
on O
his O
eyelashes: O
"Oh, O
Alexis PERSON
Ivanovitch! O
Save O
me, O
save O
me! O
Have O
some O
mercy O
upon O
me!" O
For O
a O
long O
time O
I O
could O
not O
make O
out O
what O
he O
meant, O
although O
he O
kept O
talking O
and O
talking, O
and O
constantly O
repeating O
to O
himself, O
"Have O
mercy, O
mercy!" O
At O
length, O
however, O
I O
divined O
that O
he O
was O
expecting O
me O
to O
give O
him O
something O
in O
the O
nature O
of O
advice--or, O
rather, O
that, O
deserted O
by O
every O
one, O
and O
overwhelmed O
with O
grief O
and O
apprehension, O
he O
had O
bethought O
himself O
of O
my O
existence, O
and O
sent O
for O
me O
to O
relieve O
his O
feelings O
by O
talking O
and O
talking O
and O
talking. O
In O
fact, O
he O
was O
in O
such O
a O
confused O
and O
despondent O
state O
of O
mind O
that, O
clasping O
his O
hands O
together, O
he O
actually O
went O
down O
upon O
his O
knees O
and O
begged O
me O
to O
go O
to O
Mlle. O
Blanche, O
and O
beseech O
and O
advise O
her O
to O
return O
to O
him, O
and O
to O
accept O
him O
in O
marriage. O
"But, O
General," O
I O
exclaimed, O
"possibly O
Mlle. O
Blanche O
has O
scarcely O
even O
remarked O
my O
existence? O
What O
could O
I O
do O
with O
her?" O
It O
was O
in O
vain O
that O
I O
protested, O
for O
he O
could O
understand O
nothing O
that O
was O
said O
to O
him, O
Next O
he O
started O
talking O
about O
the O
Grandmother, O
but O
always O
in O
a O
disconnected O
sort O
of O
fashion--his O
one O
thought O
being O
to O
send O
for O
the O
police. O
"In O
Russia," O
said O
he, O
suddenly O
boiling O
over O
with O
indignation, O
"or O
in O
any O
well-ordered O
State O
where O
there O
exists O
a O
government, O
old O
women O
like O
my O
mother O
are O
placed O
under O
proper O
guardianship. O
Yes, O
my O
good O
sir," O
he O
went O
on, O
relapsing O
into O
a O
scolding O
tone O
as O
he O
leapt O
to O
his O
feet O
and O
started O
to O
pace O
the O
room, O
"do O
you O
not O
know O
this" O
(he O
seemed O
to O
be O
addressing O
some O
imaginary O
auditor O
in O
the O
corner) O
"--do O
you O
not O
know O
this, O
that O
in O
Russia LOCATION
old O
women O
like O
her O
are O
subjected O
to O
restraint, O
the O
devil O
take O
them?" O
Again O
he O
threw O
himself O
down O
upon O
the O
sofa. O
A O
minute O
later, O
though O
sobbing O
and O
almost O
breathless, O
he O
managed O
to O
gasp O
out O
that O
Mlle. O
Blanche PERSON
had O
refused O
to O
marry O
him, O
for O
the O
reason O
that O
the O
Grandmother O
had O
turned O
up O
in O
place O
of O
a O
telegram, O
and O
it O
was O
therefore O
clear O
that O
he O
had O
no O
inheritance O
to O
look O
for. O
Evidently, O
he O
supposed O
that O
I O
had O
hitherto O
been O
in O
entire O
ignorance O
of O
all O
this. O
Again, O
when O
I O
referred O
to O
De O
Griers, O
the O
General O
made O
a O
gesture O
of O
despair. O
"He O
has O
gone O
away," O
he O
said, O
"and O
everything O
which O
I O
possess O
is O
mortgaged O
to O
him. O
I O
stand O
stripped O
to O
my O
skin. O
Even O
of O
the O
money O
which O
you O
brought O
me O
from O
Paris, O
I O
know O
not O
if O
seven O
hundred O
francs O
be O
left. O
Of O
course O
that O
sum O
will O
do O
to O
go O
on O
with, O
but, O
as O
regards O
the O
future, O
I O
know O
nothing, O
I O
know O
nothing." O
"Then O
how O
will O
you O
pay O
your O
hotel O
bill?" O
I O
cried O
in O
consternation. O
"And O
what O
shall O
you O
do O
afterwards?" O
He O
looked O
at O
me O
vaguely, O
but O
it O
was O
clear O
that O
he O
had O
not O
understood--perhaps O
had O
not O
even O
heard--my O
questions. O
Then O
I O
tried O
to O
get O
him O
to O
speak O
of O
Polina PERSON
and O
the O
children, O
but O
he O
only O
returned O
brief O
answers O
of O
"Yes, O
yes," O
and O
again O
started O
to O
maunder O
about O
the O
Prince, O
and O
the O
likelihood O
of O
the O
latter O
marrying O
Mlle. O
Blanche. O
"What O
on O
earth O
am O
I O
to O
do?" O
he O
concluded. O
"What O
on O
earth O
am O
I O
to O
do? O
Is O
this O
not O
ingratitude? O
Is O
it O
not O
sheer O
ingratitude?" O
And O
he O
burst O
into O
tears. O
Nothing O
could O
be O
done O
with O
such O
a O
man. O
Yet O
to O
leave O
him O
alone O
was O
dangerous, O
for O
something O
might O
happen O
to O
him. O
I O
withdrew O
from O
his O
rooms O
for O
a O
little O
while, O
but O
warned O
the O
nursemaid O
to O
keep O
an O
eye O
upon O
him, O
as O
well O
as O
exchanged O
a O
word O
with O
the O
corridor O
lacquey O
(a O
very O
talkative O
fellow), O
who O
likewise O
promised O
to O
remain O
on O
the O
look-out. O
Hardly O
had O
I O
left O
the O
General, O
when O
Potapitch PERSON
approached O
me O
with O
a O
summons O
from O
the O
Grandmother. O
It O
was O
now O
eight O
o'clock, O
and O
she O
had O
returned O
from O
the O
Casino O
after O
finally O
losing O
all O
that O
she O
possessed. O
I O
found O
her O
sitting O
in O
her O
chair--much O
distressed O
and O
evidently O
fatigued. O
Presently O
Martha PERSON
brought O
her O
up O
a O
cup O
of O
tea O
and O
forced O
her O
to O
drink O
it; O
yet, O
even O
then O
I O
could O
detect O
in O
the O
old O
lady's O
tone O
and O
manner O
a O
great O
change. O
"Good O
evening, O
Alexis PERSON
Ivanovitch," O
she O
said O
slowly, O
with O
her O
head O
drooping. O
"Pardon O
me O
for O
disturbing O
you O
again. O
Yes, O
you O
must O
pardon O
an O
old, O
old O
woman O
like O
myself, O
for O
I O
have O
left O
behind O
me O
all O
that O
I O
possess--nearly O
a O
hundred O
thousand O
roubles! O
You O
did O
quite O
right O
in O
declining O
to O
come O
with O
me O
this O
evening. O
Now O
I O
am O
without O
money--without O
a O
single O
groat. O
But O
I O
must O
not O
delay O
a O
moment; O
I O
must O
leave O
by O
the O
9:30 O
train. O
I O
have O
sent O
for O
that O
English O
friend O
of O
yours, O
and O
am O
going O
to O
beg O
of O
him O
three O
thousand O
francs O
for O
a O
week. O
Please O
try O
and O
persuade O
him O
to O
think O
nothing O
of O
it, O
nor O
yet O
to O
refuse O
me, O
for O
I O
am O
still O
a O
rich O
woman O
who O
possesses O
three O
villages O
and O
a O
couple O
of O
mansions. O
Yes, O
the O
money O
shall O
be O
found, O
for O
I O
have O
not O
yet O
squandered O
EVERYTHING. O
I O
tell O
you O
this O
in O
order O
that O
he O
may O
have O
no O
doubts O
about--Ah, O
but O
here O
he O
is! O
Clearly O
he O
is O
a O
good O
fellow." O
True O
enough, O
Astley PERSON
had O
come O
hot-foot O
on O
receiving O
the O
Grandmother's O
appeal. O
Scarcely O
stopping O
even O
to O
reflect, O
and O
with O
scarcely O
a O
word, O
he O
counted O
out O
the O
three O
thousand O
francs O
under O
a O
note O
of O
hand O
which O
she O
duly O
signed. O
Then, O
his O
business O
done, O
he O
bowed, O
and O
lost O
no O
time O
in O
taking O
his O
departure. O
"You O
too O
leave O
me, O
Alexis PERSON
Ivanovitch," PERSON
said O
the O
Grandmother. O
"All O
my O
bones O
are O
aching, O
and O
I O
still O
have O
an O
hour O
in O
which O
to O
rest. O
Do O
not O
be O
hard O
upon O
me, O
old O
fool O
that O
I O
am. O
Never O
again O
shall O
I O
blame O
young O
people O
for O
being O
frivolous. O
I O
should O
think O
it O
wrong O
even O
to O
blame O
that O
unhappy O
General O
of O
yours. O
Nevertheless, O
I O
do O
not O
mean O
to O
let O
him O
have O
any O
of O
my O
money O
(which O
is O
all O
that O
he O
desires), O
for O
the O
reason O
that O
I O
look O
upon O
him O
as O
a O
perfect O
blockhead, O
and O
consider O
myself, O
simpleton O
though O
I O
be, O
at O
least O
wiser O
than O
HE O
is. O
How O
surely O
does O
God O
visit O
old O
age, O
and O
punish O
it O
for O
its O
presumption! O
Well, O
good-bye. O
Martha, O
come O
and O
lift O
me O
up." O
However, O
I O
had O
a O
mind O
to O
see O
the O
old O
lady O
off; O
and, O
moreover, O
I O
was O
in O
an O
expectant O
frame O
of O
mind--somehow O
I O
kept O
thinking O
that O
SOMETHING O
was O
going O
to O
happen; O
wherefore, O
I O
could O
not O
rest O
quietly O
in O
my O
room, O
but O
stepped O
out O
into O
the O
corridor, O
and O
then O
into O
the O
Chestnut O
Avenue O
for O
a O
few O
minutes' O
stroll. O
My O
letter O
to O
Polina PERSON
had O
been O
clear O
and O
firm, O
and O
in O
the O
present O
crisis, O
I O
felt O
sure, O
would O
prove O
final. O
I O
had O
heard O
of O
De O
Griers' O
departure, O
and, O
however O
much O
Polina PERSON
might O
reject O
me O
as O
a O
FRIEND, O
she O
might O
not O
reject O
me O
altogether O
as O
a O
SERVANT. O
She O
would O
need O
me O
to O
fetch O
and O
carry O
for O
her, O
and O
I O
was O
ready O
to O
do O
so. O
How O
could O
it O
have O
been O
otherwise? O
Towards O
the O
hour O
of O
the O
train's O
departure O
I O
hastened O
to O
the O
station, O
and O
put O
the O
Grandmother O
into O
her O
compartment--she O
and O
her O
party O
occupying O
a O
reserved O
family O
saloon. O
"Thanks O
for O
your O
disinterested O
assistance," O
she O
said O
at O
parting. O
"Oh, O
and O
please O
remind O
Prascovia PERSON
of O
what O
I O
said O
to O
her O
last O
night. O
I O
expect O
soon O
to O
see O
her." O
Then O
I O
returned O
home. O
As O
I O
was O
passing O
the O
door O
of O
the O
General's O
suite, O
I O
met O
the O
nursemaid, O
and O
inquired O
after O
her O
master. O
"There O
is O
nothing O
new O
to O
report, O
sir," O
she O
replied O
quietly. O
Nevertheless O
I O
decided O
to O
enter, O
and O
was O
just O
doing O
so O
when O
I O
halted O
thunderstruck O
on O
the O
threshold. O
For O
before O
me O
I O
beheld O
the O
General O
and O
Mlle. O
Blanche--laughing O
gaily O
at O
one O
another!--while O
beside O
them, O
on O
the O
sofa, O
there O
was O
seated O
her O
mother. O
Clearly O
the O
General O
was O
almost O
out O
of O
his O
mind O
with O
joy, O
for O
he O
was O
talking O
all O
sorts O
of O
nonsense, O
and O
bubbling O
over O
with O
a O
long-drawn, O
nervous O
laugh--a O
laugh O
which O
twisted O
his O
face O
into O
innumerable O
wrinkles, O
and O
caused O
his O
eyes O
almost O
to O
disappear. O
Afterwards O
I O
learnt O
from O
Mlle. O
Blanche O
herself O
that, O
after O
dismissing O
the O
Prince O
and O
hearing O
of O
the O
General's O
tears, O
she O
bethought O
her O
of O
going O
to O
comfort O
the O
old O
man, O
and O
had O
just O
arrived O
for O
the O
purpose O
when O
I O
entered. O
Fortunately, O
the O
poor O
General O
did O
not O
know O
that O
his O
fate O
had O
been O
decided--that O
Mlle. O
had O
long O
ago O
packed O
her O
trunks O
in O
readiness O
for O
the O
first O
morning O
train O
to O
Paris! O
Hesitating O
a O
moment O
on O
the O
threshold O
I O
changed O
my O
mind O
as O
to O
entering, O
and O
departed O
unnoticed. O
Ascending O
to O
my O
own O
room, O
and O
opening O
the O
door, O
I O
perceived O
in O
the O
semi-darkness O
a O
figure O
seated O
on O
a O
chair O
in O
the O
corner O
by O
the O
window. O
The O
figure O
did O
not O
rise O
when O
I O
entered, O
so O
I O
approached O
it O
swiftly, O
peered O
at O
it O
closely, O
and O
felt O
my O
heart O
almost O
stop O
beating. O
The O
figure O
was O
Polina! O
XIV O
The O
shock O
made O
me O
utter O
an O
exclamation. O
"What O
is O
the O
matter? O
What O
is O
the O
matter?" O
she O
asked O
in O
a O
strange O
voice. O
She O
was O
looking O
pale, O
and O
her O
eyes O
were O
dim. O
"What O
is O
the O
matter?" O
I O
re-echoed. O
"Why, O
the O
fact O
that O
you O
are O
HERE!" O
"If O
I O
am O
here, O
I O
have O
come O
with O
all O
that O
I O
have O
to O
bring," O
she O
said. O
"Such O
has O
always O
been O
my O
way, O
as O
you O
shall O
presently O
see. O
Please O
light O
a O
candle." O
I O
did O
so; O
whereupon O
she O
rose, O
approached O
the O
table, O
and O
laid O
upon O
it O
an O
open O
letter. O
"Read O
it," O
she O
added. O
"It O
is O
De O
Griers' O
handwriting!" O
I O
cried O
as O
I O
seized O
the O
document. O
My O
hands O
were O
so O
tremulous O
that O
the O
lines O
on O
the O
pages O
danced O
before O
my O
eyes. O
Although, O
at O
this O
distance O
of O
time, O
I O
have O
forgotten O
the O
exact O
phraseology O
of O
the O
missive, O
I O
append, O
if O
not O
the O
precise O
words, O
at O
all O
events O
the O
general O
sense. O
"Mademoiselle," O
the O
document O
ran, O
"certain O
untoward O
circumstances O
compel O
me O
to O
depart O
in O
haste. O
Of O
course, O
you O
have O
of O
yourself O
remarked O
that O
hitherto O
I O
have O
always O
refrained O
from O
having O
any O
final O
explanation O
with O
you, O
for O
the O
reason O
that O
I O
could O
not O
well O
state O
the O
whole O
circumstances; O
and O
now O
to O
my O
difficulties O
the O
advent O
of O
the O
aged O
Grandmother, O
coupled O
with O
her O
subsequent O
proceedings, O
has O
put O
the O
final O
touch. O
Also, O
the O
involved O
state O
of O
my O
affairs O
forbids O
me O
to O
write O
with O
any O
finality O
concerning O
those O
hopes O
of O
ultimate O
bliss O
upon O
which, O
for O
a O
long O
while O
past, O
I O
have O
permitted O
myself O
to O
feed. O
I O
regret O
the O
past, O
but O
at O
the O
same O
time O
hope O
that O
in O
my O
conduct O
you O
have O
never O
been O
able O
to O
detect O
anything O
that O
was O
unworthy O
of O
a O
gentleman O
and O
a O
man O
of O
honour. O
Having O
lost, O
however, O
almost O
the O
whole O
of O
my O
money O
in O
debts O
incurred O
by O
your O
stepfather, O
I O
find O
myself O
driven O
to O
the O
necessity O
of O
saving O
the O
remainder; O
wherefore, O
I O
have O
instructed O
certain O
friends O
of O
mine O
in O
St. LOCATION
Petersburg LOCATION
to O
arrange O
for O
the O
sale O
of O
all O
the O
property O
which O
has O
been O
mortgaged O
to O
myself. O
At O
the O
same O
time, O
knowing O
that, O
in O
addition, O
your O
frivolous O
stepfather O
has O
squandered O
money O
which O
is O
exclusively O
yours, O
I O
have O
decided O
to O
absolve O
him O
from O
a O
certain O
moiety O
of O
the O
mortgages O
on O
his O
property, O
in O
order O
that O
you O
may O
be O
in O
a O
position O
to O
recover O
of O
him O
what O
you O
have O
lost, O
by O
suing O
him O
in O
legal O
fashion. O
I O
trust, O
therefore, O
that, O
as O
matters O
now O
stand, O
this O
action O
of O
mine O
may O
bring O
you O
some O
advantage. O
I O
trust O
also O
that O
this O
same O
action O
leaves O
me O
in O
the O
position O
of O
having O
fulfilled O
every O
obligation O
which O
is O
incumbent O
upon O
a O
man O
of O
honour O
and O
refinement. O
Rest O
assured O
that O
your O
memory O
will O
for O
ever O
remain O
graven O
in O
my O
heart." O
"All O
this O
is O
clear O
enough," O
I O
commented. O
"Surely O
you O
did O
not O
expect O
aught O
else O
from O
him?" O
Somehow O
I O
was O
feeling O
annoyed. O
"I O
expected O
nothing O
at O
all O
from O
him," O
she O
replied--quietly O
enough, O
to O
all O
outward O
seeming, O
yet O
with O
a O
note O
of O
irritation O
in O
her O
tone. O
"Long O
ago O
I O
made O
up O
my O
mind O
on O
the O
subject, O
for O
I O
could O
read O
his O
thoughts, O
and O
knew O
what O
he O
was O
thinking. O
He O
thought O
that O
possibly O
I O
should O
sue O
him--that O
one O
day O
I O
might O
become O
a O
nuisance." O
Here O
Polina PERSON
halted O
for O
a O
moment, O
and O
stood O
biting O
her O
lips. O
"So O
of O
set O
purpose O
I O
redoubled O
my O
contemptuous O
treatment O
of O
him, O
and O
waited O
to O
see O
what O
he O
would O
do. O
If O
a O
telegram O
to O
say O
that O
we O
had O
become O
legatees O
had O
arrived O
from, O
St. O
Petersburg, O
I O
should O
have O
flung O
at O
him O
a O
quittance O
for O
my O
foolish O
stepfather's O
debts, O
and O
then O
dismissed O
him. O
For O
a O
long O
time O
I O
have O
hated O
him. O
Even O
in O
earlier O
days O
he O
was O
not O
a O
man; O
and O
now!--Oh, O
how O
gladly O
I O
could O
throw O
those O
fifty O
thousand O
roubles O
in O
his O
face, O
and O
spit O
in O
it, O
and O
then O
rub O
the O
spittle O
in!" O
"But O
the O
document O
returning O
the O
fifty-thousand O
rouble O
mortgage--has O
the O
General O
got O
it? O
If O
so, O
possess O
yourself O
of O
it, O
and O
send O
it O
to O
De O
Griers." O
"No, O
no; O
the O
General O
has O
not O
got O
it." O
"Just O
as O
I O
expected! O
Well, O
what O
is O
the O
General O
going O
to O
do?" O
Then O
an O
idea O
suddenly O
occurred O
to O
me. O
"What O
about O
the O
Grandmother?" O
I O
asked. O
Polina PERSON
looked O
at O
me O
with O
impatience O
and O
bewilderment. O
"What O
makes O
you O
speak O
of O
HER?" O
was O
her O
irritable O
inquiry. O
"I O
cannot O
go O
and O
live O
with O
her. O
Nor," O
she O
added O
hotly, O
"will O
I O
go O
down O
upon O
my O
knees O
to O
ANY O
ONE." O
"Why O
should O
you?" O
I O
cried. O
"Yet O
to O
think O
that O
you O
should O
have O
loved O
De O
Griers! O
The O
villain, O
the O
villain! O
But O
I O
will O
kill O
him O
in O
a O
duel. O
Where O
is O
he O
now?" O
"In O
Frankfort, O
where O
he O
will O
be O
staying O
for O
the O
next O
three O
days." O
"Well, O
bid O
me O
do O
so, O
and O
I O
will O
go O
to O
him O
by O
the O
first O
train O
tomorrow," O
I O
exclaimed O
with O
enthusiasm. O
She O
smiled. O
"If O
you O
were O
to O
do O
that," O
she O
said, O
"he O
would O
merely O
tell O
you O
to O
be O
so O
good O
as O
first O
to O
return O
him O
the O
fifty O
thousand O
francs. O
What, O
then, O
would O
be O
the O
use O
of O
having O
a O
quarrel O
with O
him? O
You O
talk O
sheer O
nonsense." O
I O
ground O
my O
teeth. O
"The O
question," O
I O
went O
on, O
"is O
how O
to O
raise O
the O
fifty O
thousand O
francs. O
We O
cannot O
expect O
to O
find O
them O
lying O
about O
on O
the O
floor. O
Listen. O
What O
of O
Mr. O
Astley?" O
Even O
as O
I O
spoke O
a O
new O
and O
strange O
idea O
formed O
itself O
in O
my O
brain. O
Her O
eyes O
flashed O
fire. O
"What? O
YOU O
YOURSELF O
wish O
me O
to O
leave O
you O
for O
him?" O
she O
cried O
with O
a O
scornful O
look O
and O
a O
proud O
smile. O
Never O
before O
had O
she O
addressed O
me O
thus. O
Then O
her O
head O
must O
have O
turned O
dizzy O
with O
emotion, O
for O
suddenly O
she O
seated O
herself O
upon O
the O
sofa, O
as O
though O
she O
were O
powerless O
any O
longer O
to O
stand. O
A O
flash O
of O
lightning O
seemed O
to O
strike O
me O
as O
I O
stood O
there. O
I O
could O
scarcely O
believe O
my O
eyes O
or O
my O
ears. O
She O
DID O
love O
me, O
then! O
It O
WAS O
to O
me, O
and O
not O
to O
Mr. O
Astley, O
that O
she O
had O
turned! O
Although O
she, O
an O
unprotected O
girl, O
had O
come O
to O
me O
in O
my O
room--in O
an O
hotel O
room--and O
had O
probably O
compromised O
herself O
thereby, O
I O
had O
not O
understood! O
Then O
a O
second O
mad O
idea O
flashed O
into O
my O
brain. O
"Polina," O
I O
said, O
"give O
me O
but O
an O
hour. O
Wait O
here O
just O
one O
hour O
until O
I O
return. O
Yes, O
you O
MUST O
do O
so. O
Do O
you O
not O
see O
what O
I O
mean? O
Just O
stay O
here O
for O
that O
time." O
And O
I O
rushed O
from O
the O
room O
without O
so O
much O
as O
answering O
her O
look O
of O
inquiry. O
She O
called O
something O
after O
me, O
but O
I O
did O
not O
return. O
Sometimes O
it O
happens O
that O
the O
most O
insane O
thought, O
the O
most O
impossible O
conception, O
will O
become O
so O
fixed O
in O
one's O
head O
that O
at O
length O
one O
believes O
the O
thought O
or O
the O
conception O
to O
be O
reality. O
Moreover, O
if O
with O
the O
thought O
or O
the O
conception O
there O
is O
combined O
a O
strong, O
a O
passionate, O
desire, O
one O
will O
come O
to O
look O
upon O
the O
said O
thought O
or O
conception O
as O
something O
fated, O
inevitable, O
and O
foreordained--something O
bound O
to O
happen. O
Whether O
by O
this O
there O
is O
connoted O
something O
in O
the O
nature O
of O
a O
combination O
of O
presentiments, O
or O
a O
great O
effort O
of O
will, O
or O
a O
self-annulment O
of O
one's O
true O
expectations, O
and O
so O
on, O
I O
do O
not O
know; O
but, O
at O
all O
events O
that O
night O
saw O
happen O
to O
me O
(a O
night O
which O
I O
shall O
never O
forget) O
something O
in O
the O
nature O
of O
the O
miraculous. O
Although O
the O
occurrence O
can O
easily O
be O
explained O
by O
arithmetic, O
I O
still O
believe O
it O
to O
have O
been O
a O
miracle. O
Yet O
why O
did O
this O
conviction O
take O
such O
a O
hold O
upon O
me O
at O
the O
time, O
and O
remain O
with O
me O
ever O
since? O
Previously, O
I O
had O
thought O
of O
the O
idea, O
not O
as O
an O
occurrence O
which O
was O
ever O
likely O
to O
come O
about, O
but O
as O
something O
which O
NEVER O
could O
come O
about. O
The O
time O
was O
a O
quarter O
past O
eleven O
o'clock O
when O
I O
entered O
the O
Casino O
in O
such O
a O
state O
of O
hope O
(though, O
at O
the O
same O
time, O
of O
agitation) O
as O
I O
had O
never O
before O
experienced. O
In O
the O
gaming-rooms O
there O
were O
still O
a O
large O
number O
of O
people, O
but O
not O
half O
as O
many O
as O
had O
been O
present O
in O
the O
morning. O
At O
eleven O
o'clock O
there O
usually O
remained O
behind O
only O
the O
real, O
the O
desperate O
gamblers--persons O
for O
whom, O
at O
spas, O
there O
existed O
nothing O
beyond O
roulette, O
and O
who O
went O
thither O
for O
that O
alone. O
These O
gamesters O
took O
little O
note O
of O
what O
was O
going O
on O
around O
them, O
and O
were O
interested O
in O
none O
of O
the O
appurtenances O
of O
the O
season, O
but O
played O
from O
morning O
till O
night, O
and O
would O
have O
been O
ready O
to O
play O
through O
the O
night O
until O
dawn O
had O
that O
been O
possible. O
As O
it O
was, O
they O
used O
to O
disperse O
unwillingly O
when, O
at O
midnight, O
roulette O
came O
to O
an O
end. O
Likewise, O
as O
soon O
as O
ever O
roulette O
was O
drawing O
to O
a O
close O
and O
the O
head O
croupier O
had O
called O
"Les O
trois O
derniers O
coups," O
most O
of O
them O
were O
ready O
to O
stake O
on O
the O
last O
three O
rounds O
all O
that O
they O
had O
in O
their O
pockets--and, O
for O
the O
most O
part, O
lost O
it. O
For O
my O
own O
part O
I O
proceeded O
towards O
the O
table O
at O
which O
the O
Grandmother O
had O
lately O
sat; O
and, O
since O
the O
crowd O
around O
it O
was O
not O
very O
large, O
I O
soon O
obtained O
standing O
room O
among O
the O
ring O
of O
gamblers, O
while O
directly O
in O
front O
of O
me, O
on O
the O
green O
cloth, O
I O
saw O
marked O
the O
word O
"Passe." O
"Passe" O
was O
a O
row O
of O
numbers O
from O
19 O
to O
36 O
inclusive; O
while O
a O
row O
of O
numbers O
from O
1 O
to O
18 O
inclusive O
was O
known O
as O
"Manque." O
But O
what O
had O
that O
to O
do O
with O
me? O
I O
had O
not O
noticed--I O
had O
not O
so O
much O
as O
heard O
the O
numbers O
upon O
which O
the O
previous O
coup O
had O
fallen, O
and O
so O
took O
no O
bearings O
when O
I O
began O
to O
play, O
as, O
in O
my O
place, O
any O
SYSTEMATIC O
gambler O
would O
have O
done. O
No, O
I O
merely O
extended O
my O
stock O
of O
twenty O
ten-gulden O
pieces, O
and O
threw O
them O
down O
upon O
the O
space O
"Passe" O
which O
happened O
to O
be O
confronting O
me. O
"Vingt-deux!" O
called O
the O
croupier. O
I O
had O
won! O
I O
staked O
upon O
the O
same O
again--both O
my O
original O
stake O
and O
my O
winnings. O
"Trente-et-un!" O
called O
the O
croupier. O
Again O
I O
had O
won, O
and O
was O
now O
in O
possession O
of O
eighty O
ten-gulden O
pieces. O
Next, O
I O
moved O
the O
whole O
eighty O
on O
to O
twelve O
middle O
numbers O
(a O
stake O
which, O
if O
successful, O
would O
bring O
me O
in O
a O
triple O
profit, O
but O
also O
involved O
a O
risk O
of O
two O
chances O
to O
one). O
The O
wheel O
revolved, O
and O
stopped O
at O
twenty-four. O
Upon O
this O
I O
was O
paid O
out O
notes O
and O
gold O
until O
I O
had O
by O
my O
side O
a O
total O
sum O
of O
two O
thousand O
gulden. O
It O
was O
as O
in O
a O
fever O
that O
I O
moved O
the O
pile, O
en O
bloc, O
on O
to O
the O
red. O
Then O
suddenly O
I O
came O
to O
myself O
(though O
that O
was O
the O
only O
time O
during O
the O
evening's O
play O
when O
fear O
cast O
its O
cold O
spell O
over O
me, O
and O
showed O
itself O
in O
a O
trembling O
of O
the O
hands O
and O
knees). O
For O
with O
horror O
I O
had O
realised O
that O
I O
MUST O
win, O
and O
that O
upon O
that O
stake O
there O
depended O
all O
my O
life. O
"Rouge!" O
called O
the O
croupier. O
I O
drew O
a O
long O
breath, O
and O
hot O
shivers O
went O
coursing O
over O
my O
body. O
I O
was O
paid O
out O
my O
winnings O
in O
bank-notes--amounting, O
of O
course, O
to O
a O
total O
of O
four O
thousand O
florins, O
eight O
hundred O
gulden O
(I O
could O
still O
calculate O
the O
amounts). O
After O
that, O
I O
remember, O
I O
again O
staked O
two O
thousand O
florins O
upon O
twelve O
middle O
numbers, O
and O
lost. O
Again O
I O
staked O
the O
whole O
of O
my O
gold, O
with O
eight O
hundred O
gulden, O
in O
notes, O
and O
lost. O
Then O
madness O
seemed O
to O
come O
upon O
me, O
and O
seizing O
my O
last O
two O
thousand O
florins, O
I O
staked O
them O
upon O
twelve O
of O
the O
first O
numbers--wholly O
by O
chance, O
and O
at O
random, O
and O
without O
any O
sort O
of O
reckoning. O
Upon O
my O
doing O
so O
there O
followed O
a O
moment O
of O
suspense O
only O
comparable O
to O
that O
which O
Madame PERSON
Blanchard PERSON
must O
have O
experienced O
when, O
in O
Paris, O
she O
was O
descending O
earthwards O
from O
a O
balloon. O
"Quatre!" O
called O
the O
croupier. O
Once O
more, O
with O
the O
addition O
of O
my O
original O
stake, O
I O
was O
in O
possession O
of O
six O
thousand O
florins! O
Once O
more O
I O
looked O
around O
me O
like O
a O
conqueror--once O
more O
I O
feared O
nothing O
as O
I O
threw O
down O
four O
thousand O
of O
these O
florins O
upon O
the O
black. O
The O
croupiers O
glanced O
around O
them, O
and O
exchanged O
a O
few O
words; O
the O
bystanders O
murmured O
expectantly. O
The O
black O
turned O
up. O
After O
that O
I O
do O
not O
exactly O
remember O
either O
my O
calculations O
or O
the O
order O
of O
my O
stakings. O
I O
only O
remember O
that, O
as O
in O
a O
dream, O
I O
won O
in O
one O
round O
sixteen O
thousand O
florins; O
that O
in O
the O
three O
following O
rounds, O
I O
lost O
twelve O
thousand; O
that O
I O
moved O
the O
remainder O
(four O
thousand) O
on O
to O
"Passe" O
(though O
quite O
unconscious O
of O
what O
I O
was O
doing--I O
was O
merely O
waiting, O
as O
it O
were, O
mechanically, O
and O
without O
reflection, O
for O
something) O
and O
won; O
and O
that, O
finally, O
four O
times O
in O
succession O
I O
lost. O
Yes, O
I O
can O
remember O
raking O
in O
money O
by O
thousands--but O
most O
frequently O
on O
the O
twelve, O
middle O
numbers, O
to O
which O
I O
constantly O
adhered, O
and O
which O
kept O
appearing O
in O
a O
sort O
of O
regular O
order--first, O
three O
or O
four O
times O
running, O
and O
then, O
after O
an O
interval O
of O
a O
couple O
of O
rounds, O
in O
another O
break O
of O
three O
or O
four O
appearances. O
Sometimes, O
this O
astonishing O
regularity O
manifested O
itself O
in O
patches; O
a O
thing O
to O
upset O
all O
the O
calculations O
of O
note--taking O
gamblers O
who O
play O
with O
a O
pencil O
and O
a O
memorandum O
book O
in O
their O
hands O
Fortune O
perpetrates O
some O
terrible O
jests O
at O
roulette! O
Since O
my O
entry O
not O
more O
than O
half O
an O
hour O
could O
have O
elapsed. O
Suddenly O
a O
croupier O
informed O
me O
that O
I O
had, O
won O
thirty O
thousand O
florins, O
as O
well O
as O
that, O
since O
the O
latter O
was O
the O
limit O
for O
which, O
at O
any O
one O
time, O
the O
bank O
could O
make O
itself O
responsible, O
roulette O
at O
that O
table O
must O
close O
for O
the O
night. O
Accordingly, O
I O
caught O
up O
my O
pile O
of O
gold, O
stuffed O
it O
into O
my O
pocket, O
and, O
grasping O
my O
sheaf O
of O
bank-notes, O
moved O
to O
the O
table O
in O
an O
adjoining O
salon O
where O
a O
second O
game O
of O
roulette O
was O
in O
progress. O
The O
crowd O
followed O
me O
in O
a O
body, O
and O
cleared O
a O
place O
for O
me O
at O
the O
table; O
after O
which, O
I O
proceeded O
to O
stake O
as O
before--that O
is O
to O
say, O
at O
random O
and O
without O
calculating. O
What O
saved O
me O
from O
ruin O
I O
do O
not O
know. O
Of O
course O
there O
were O
times O
when O
fragmentary O
reckonings O
DID O
come O
flashing O
into O
my O
brain. O
For O
instance, O
there O
were O
times O
when O
I O
attached O
myself O
for O
a O
while O
to O
certain O
figures O
and O
coups--though O
always O
leaving O
them, O
again O
before O
long, O
without O
knowing O
what O
I O
was O
doing. O
In O
fact, O
I O
cannot O
have O
been O
in O
possession O
of O
all O
my O
faculties, O
for O
I O
can O
remember O
the O
croupiers O
correcting O
my O
play O
more O
than O
once, O
owing O
to O
my O
having O
made O
mistakes O
of O
the O
gravest O
order. O
My O
brows O
were O
damp O
with O
sweat, O
and O
my O
hands O
were O
shaking. O
Also, O
Poles O
came O
around O
me O
to O
proffer O
their O
services, O
but O
I O
heeded O
none O
of O
them. O
Nor O
did O
my O
luck O
fail O
me O
now. O
Suddenly, O
there O
arose O
around O
me O
a O
loud O
din O
of O
talking O
and O
laughter. O
"Bravo, O
bravo!" O
was O
the O
general O
shout, O
and O
some O
people O
even O
clapped O
their O
hands. O
I O
had O
raked O
in O
thirty O
thousand O
florins, O
and O
again O
the O
bank O
had O
had O
to O
close O
for O
the O
night! O
"Go O
away O
now, O
go O
away O
now," O
a O
voice O
whispered O
to O
me O
on O
my O
right. O
The O
person O
who O
had O
spoken O
to O
me O
was O
a O
certain O
Jew O
of O
Frankfurt--a O
man O
who O
had O
been O
standing O
beside O
me O
the O
whole O
while, O
and O
occasionally O
helping O
me O
in O
my O
play. O
"Yes, O
for O
God's O
sake O
go," O
whispered O
a O
second O
voice O
in O
my O
left O
ear. O
Glancing O
around, O
I O
perceived O
that O
the O
second O
voice O
had O
come O
from O
a O
modestly, O
plainly O
dressed O
lady O
of O
rather O
less O
than O
thirty--a O
woman O
whose O
face, O
though O
pale O
and O
sickly-looking, O
bore O
also O
very O
evident O
traces O
of O
former O
beauty. O
At O
the O
moment, O
I O
was O
stuffing O
the O
crumpled O
bank-notes O
into O
my O
pockets O
and O
collecting O
all O
the O
gold O
that O
was O
left O
on O
the O
table. O
Seizing O
up O
my O
last O
note O
for O
five O
hundred O
gulden, O
I O
contrived O
to O
insinuate O
it, O
unperceived, O
into O
the O
hand O
of O
the O
pale O
lady. O
An O
overpowering O
impulse O
had O
made O
me O
do O
so, O
and O
I O
remember O
how O
her O
thin O
little O
fingers O
pressed O
mine O
in O
token O
of O
her O
lively O
gratitude. O
The O
whole O
affair O
was O
the O
work O
of O
a O
moment. O
Then, O
collecting O
my O
belongings, O
I O
crossed O
to O
where O
trente O
et O
quarante O
was O
being O
played--a O
game O
which O
could O
boast O
of O
a O
more O
aristocratic O
public, O
and O
was O
played O
with O
cards O
instead O
of O
with O
a O
wheel. O
At O
this O
diversion O
the O
bank O
made O
itself O
responsible O
for O
a O
hundred O
thousand O
thalers O
as O
the O
limit, O
but O
the O
highest O
stake O
allowable O
was, O
as O
in O
roulette, O
four O
thousand O
florins. O
Although O
I O
knew O
nothing O
of O
the O
game--and O
I O
scarcely O
knew O
the O
stakes, O
except O
those O
on O
black O
and O
red--I O
joined O
the O
ring O
of O
players, O
while O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
crowd O
massed O
itself O
around O
me. O
At O
this O
distance O
of O
time O
I O
cannot O
remember O
whether O
I O
ever O
gave O
a O
thought O
to O
Polina; O
I O
seemed O
only O
to O
be O
conscious O
of O
a O
vague O
pleasure O
in O
seizing O
and O
raking O
in O
the O
bank-notes O
which O
kept O
massing O
themselves O
in O
a O
pile O
before O
me. O
But, O
as O
ever, O
fortune O
seemed O
to O
be O
at O
my O
back. O
As O
though O
of O
set O
purpose, O
there O
came O
to O
my O
aid O
a O
circumstance O
which O
not O
infrequently O
repeats O
itself O
in O
gaming. O
The O
circumstance O
is O
that O
not O
infrequently O
luck O
attaches O
itself O
to, O
say, O
the O
red, O
and O
does O
not O
leave O
it O
for O
a O
space O
of O
say, O
ten, O
or O
even O
fifteen, O
rounds O
in O
succession. O
Three O
days O
ago O
I O
had O
heard O
that, O
during O
the O
previous O
week O
there O
had O
been O
a O
run O
of O
twenty-two O
coups O
on O
the O
red--an O
occurrence O
never O
before O
known O
at O
roulette--so O
that O
men O
spoke O
of O
it O
with O
astonishment. O
Naturally O
enough, O
many O
deserted O
the O
red O
after O
a O
dozen O
rounds, O
and O
practically O
no O
one O
could O
now O
be O
found O
to O
stake O
upon O
it. O
Yet O
upon O
the O
black O
also--the O
antithesis O
of O
the O
red--no O
experienced O
gambler O
would O
stake O
anything, O
for O
the O
reason O
that O
every O
practised O
player O
knows O
the O
meaning O
of O
"capricious O
fortune." O
That O
is O
to O
say, O
after O
the O
sixteenth O
(or O
so) O
success O
of O
the O
red, O
one O
would O
think O
that O
the O
seventeenth O
coup O
would O
inevitably O
fall O
upon O
the O
black; O
wherefore, O
novices O
would O
be O
apt O
to O
back O
the O
latter O
in O
the O
seventeenth O
round, O
and O
even O
to O
double O
or O
treble O
their O
stakes O
upon O
it--only, O
in O
the O
end, O
to O
lose. O
Yet O
some O
whim O
or O
other O
led O
me, O
on O
remarking O
that O
the O
red O
had O
come O
up O
consecutively O
for O
seven O
times, O
to O
attach O
myself O
to O
that O
colour. O
Probably O
this O
was O
mostly O
due O
to O
self-conceit, O
for O
I O
wanted O
to O
astonish O
the O
bystanders O
with O
the O
riskiness O
of O
my O
play. O
Also, O
I O
remember O
that--oh, O
strange O
sensation!--I O
suddenly, O
and O
without O
any O
challenge O
from O
my O
own O
presumption, O
became O
obsessed O
with O
a O
DESIRE O
to O
take O
risks. O
If O
the O
spirit O
has O
passed O
through O
a O
great O
many O
sensations, O
possibly O
it O
can O
no O
longer O
be O
sated O
with O
them, O
but O
grows O
more O
excited, O
and O
demands O
more O
sensations, O
and O
stronger O
and O
stronger O
ones, O
until O
at O
length O
it O
falls O
exhausted. O
Certainly, O
if O
the O
rules O
of O
the O
game O
had O
permitted O
even O
of O
my O
staking O
fifty O
thousand O
florins O
at O
a O
time, O
I O
should O
have O
staked O
them. O
All O
of O
a O
sudden O
I O
heard O
exclamations O
arising O
that O
the O
whole O
thing O
was O
a O
marvel, O
since O
the O
red O
was O
turning O
up O
for O
the O
fourteenth O
time! O
"Monsieur O
a O
gagne O
cent O
mille O
florins," O
a O
voice O
exclaimed O
beside O
me. O
I O
awoke O
to O
my O
senses. O
What? O
I O
had O
won O
a O
hundred O
thousand O
florins? O
If O
so, O
what O
more O
did O
I O
need O
to O
win? O
I O
grasped O
the O
banknotes, O
stuffed O
them O
into O
my O
pockets, O
raked O
in O
the O
gold O
without O
counting O
it, O
and O
started O
to O
leave O
the O
Casino. O
As O
I O
passed O
through O
the O
salons O
people O
smiled O
to O
see O
my O
bulging O
pockets O
and O
unsteady O
gait, O
for O
the O
weight O
which O
I O
was O
carrying O
must O
have O
amounted O
to O
half O
a O
pood! O
Several O
hands O
I O
saw O
stretched O
out O
in O
my O
direction, O
and O
as O
I O
passed O
I O
filled O
them O
with O
all O
the O
money O
that O
I O
could O
grasp O
in O
my O
own. O
At O
length O
two O
Jews O
stopped O
me O
near O
the O
exit. O
"You O
are O
a O
bold O
young O
fellow," O
one O
said, O
"but O
mind O
you O
depart O
early O
tomorrow--as O
early O
as O
you O
can--for O
if O
you O
do O
not O
you O
will O
lose O
everything O
that O
you O
have O
won." O
But O
I O
did O
not O
heed O
them. O
The O
Avenue O
was O
so O
dark O
that O
it O
was O
barely O
possible O
to O
distinguish O
one's O
hand O
before O
one's O
face, O
while O
the O
distance O
to O
the O
hotel O
was O
half O
a O
verst O
or O
so; O
but O
I O
feared O
neither O
pickpockets O
nor O
highwaymen. O
Indeed, O
never O
since O
my O
boyhood O
have O
I O
done O
that. O
Also, O
I O
cannot O
remember O
what O
I O
thought O
about O
on O
the O
way. O
I O
only O
felt O
a O
sort O
of O
fearful O
pleasure--the O
pleasure O
of O
success, O
of O
conquest, O
of O
power O
(how O
can O
I O
best O
express O
it?). O
Likewise, O
before O
me O
there O
flitted O
the O
image O
of O
Polina; O
and O
I O
kept O
remembering, O
and O
reminding O
myself, O
that O
it O
was O
to O
HER O
I O
was O
going, O
that O
it O
was O
in O
HER O
presence O
I O
should O
soon O
be O
standing, O
that O
it O
was O
SHE O
to O
whom O
I O
should O
soon O
be O
able O
to O
relate O
and O
show O
everything. O
Scarcely O
once O
did O
I O
recall O
what O
she O
had O
lately O
said O
to O
me, O
or O
the O
reason O
why O
I O
had O
left O
her, O
or O
all O
those O
varied O
sensations O
which O
I O
had O
been O
experiencing O
a O
bare O
hour O
and O
a O
half O
ago. O
No, O
those O
sensations O
seemed O
to O
be O
things O
of O
the O
past, O
to O
be O
things O
which O
had O
righted O
themselves O
and O
grown O
old, O
to O
be O
things O
concerning O
which O
we O
needed O
to O
trouble O
ourselves O
no O
longer, O
since, O
for O
us, O
life O
was O
about O
to O
begin O
anew. O
Yet O
I O
had O
just O
reached O
the O
end O
of O
the O
Avenue O
when O
there O
DID O
come O
upon O
me O
a O
fear O
of O
being O
robbed O
or O
murdered. O
With O
each O
step O
the O
fear O
increased O
until, O
in O
my O
terror, O
I O
almost O
started O
to O
run. O
Suddenly, O
as O
I O
issued O
from O
the O
Avenue, O
there O
burst O
upon O
me O
the O
lights O
of O
the O
hotel, O
sparkling O
with O
a O
myriad O
lamps! O
Yes, O
thanks O
be O
to O
God, O
I O
had O
reached O
home! O
Running O
up O
to O
my O
room, O
I O
flung O
open O
the O
door O
of O
it. O
Polina PERSON
was O
still O
on O
the O
sofa, O
with O
a O
lighted O
candle O
in O
front O
of O
her, O
and O
her O
hands O
clasped. O
As O
I O
entered O
she O
stared O
at O
me O
in O
astonishment O
(for, O
at O
the O
moment, O
I O
must O
have O
presented O
a O
strange O
spectacle). O
All O
I O
did, O
however, O
was O
to O
halt O
before O
her, O
and O
fling O
upon O
the O
table O
my O
burden O
of O
wealth. O
XV O
I O
remember, O
too, O
how, O
without O
moving O
from O
her O
place, O
or O
changing O
her O
attitude, O
she O
gazed O
into O
my O
face. O
"I O
have O
won O
two O
hundred O
thousand O
francs!" O
cried O
I O
as O
I O
pulled O
out O
my O
last O
sheaf O
of O
bank-notes. O
The O
pile O
of O
paper O
currency O
occupied O
the O
whole O
table. O
I O
could O
not O
withdraw O
my O
eyes O
from O
it. O
Consequently, O
for O
a O
moment O
or O
two O
Polina PERSON
escaped O
my O
mind. O
Then O
I O
set O
myself O
to O
arrange O
the O
pile O
in O
order, O
and O
to O
sort O
the O
notes, O
and O
to O
mass O
the O
gold O
in O
a O
separate O
heap. O
That O
done, O
I O
left O
everything O
where O
it O
lay, O
and O
proceeded O
to O
pace O
the O
room O
with O
rapid O
strides O
as O
I O
lost O
myself O
in O
thought. O
Then O
I O
darted O
to O
the O
table O
once O
more, O
and O
began O
to O
recount O
the O
money; O
until O
all O
of O
a O
sudden, O
as O
though O
I O
had O
remembered O
something, O
I O
rushed O
to O
the O
door, O
and O
closed O
and O
double-locked O
it. O
Finally O
I O
came O
to O
a O
meditative O
halt O
before O
my O
little O
trunk. O
"Shall O
I O
put O
the O
money O
there O
until O
tomorrow?" O
I O
asked, O
turning O
sharply O
round O
to O
Polina PERSON
as O
the O
recollection O
of O
her O
returned O
to O
me. O
She O
was O
still O
in O
her O
old O
place--still O
making O
not O
a O
sound. O
Yet O
her O
eyes O
had O
followed O
every O
one O
of O
my O
movements. O
Somehow O
in O
her O
face O
there O
was O
a O
strange O
expression--an O
expression O
which O
I O
did O
not O
like. O
I O
think O
that O
I O
shall O
not O
be O
wrong O
if O
I O
say O
that O
it O
indicated O
sheer O
hatred. O
Impulsively O
I O
approached O
her. O
"Polina," O
I O
said, O
"here O
are O
twenty-five O
thousand O
florins--fifty O
thousand O
francs, O
or O
more. O
Take O
them, O
and O
tomorrow O
throw O
them O
in O
De O
Griers' O
face." O
She O
returned O
no O
answer. O
"Or, O
if O
you O
should O
prefer," O
I O
continued, O
"let O
me O
take O
them O
to O
him O
myself O
tomorrow--yes, O
early O
tomorrow O
morning. O
Shall O
I?" O
Then O
all O
at O
once O
she O
burst O
out O
laughing, O
and O
laughed O
for O
a O
long O
while. O
With O
astonishment O
and O
a O
feeling O
of O
offence O
I O
gazed O
at O
her. O
Her O
laughter O
was O
too O
like O
the O
derisive O
merriment O
which O
she O
had O
so O
often O
indulged O
in O
of O
late--merriment O
which O
had O
broken O
forth O
always O
at O
the O
time O
of O
my O
most O
passionate O
explanations. O
At O
length O
she O
ceased, O
and O
frowned O
at O
me O
from O
under O
her O
eyebrows. O
"I O
am O
NOT O
going O
to O
take O
your O
money," O
she O
said O
contemptuously. O
"Why O
not?" O
I O
cried. O
"Why O
not, O
Polina?" O
"Because O
I O
am O
not O
in O
the O
habit O
of O
receiving O
money O
for O
nothing." O
"But O
I O
am O
offering O
it O
to O
you O
as O
a O
FRIEND O
in O
the O
same O
way O
I O
would O
offer O
you O
my O
very O
life." O
Upon O
this O
she O
threw O
me O
a O
long, O
questioning O
glance, O
as O
though O
she O
were O
seeking O
to O
probe O
me O
to O
the O
depths. O
"You O
are O
giving O
too O
much O
for O
me," O
she O
remarked O
with O
a O
smile. O
"The O
beloved O
of O
De O
Griers O
is O
not O
worth O
fifty O
thousand O
francs." O
"Oh O
Polina, O
how O
can O
you O
speak O
so?" O
I O
exclaimed O
reproachfully. O
"Am O
I O
De O
Griers?" O
"You?" O
she O
cried O
with O
her O
eyes O
suddenly O
flashing. O
"Why, O
I O
HATE O
you! O
Yes, O
yes, O
I O
HATE O
you! O
I O
love O
you O
no O
more O
than O
I O
do O
De O
Griers." O
Then O
she O
buried O
her O
face O
in O
her O
hands, O
and O
relapsed O
into O
hysterics. O
I O
darted O
to O
her O
side. O
Somehow O
I O
had O
an O
intuition O
of O
something O
having O
happened O
to O
her O
which O
had O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
myself. O
She O
was O
like O
a O
person O
temporarily O
insane. O
"Buy O
me, O
would O
you, O
would O
you? O
Would O
you O
buy O
me O
for O
fifty O
thousand O
francs O
as O
De O
Griers O
did?" O
she O
gasped O
between O
her O
convulsive O
sobs. O
I O
clasped O
her O
in O
my O
arms, O
kissed O
her O
hands O
and O
feet, O
and O
fell O
upon O
my O
knees O
before O
her. O
Presently O
the O
hysterical O
fit O
passed O
away, O
and, O
laying O
her O
hands O
upon O
my O
shoulders, O
she O
gazed O
for O
a O
while O
into O
my O
face, O
as O
though O
trying O
to O
read O
it--something O
I O
said O
to O
her, O
but O
it O
was O
clear O
that O
she O
did O
not O
hear O
it. O
Her O
face O
looked O
so O
dark O
and O
despondent O
that O
I O
began O
to O
fear O
for O
her O
reason. O
At O
length O
she O
drew O
me O
towards O
herself--a O
trustful O
smile O
playing O
over O
her O
features; O
and O
then, O
as O
suddenly, O
she O
pushed O
me O
away O
again O
as O
she O
eyed O
me O
dimly. O
Finally O
she O
threw O
herself O
upon O
me O
in O
an O
embrace. O
"You O
love O
me?" O
she O
said. O
"DO O
you?--you O
who O
were O
willing O
even O
to O
quarrel O
with O
the O
Baron O
at O
my O
bidding?" O
Then O
she O
laughed--laughed O
as O
though O
something O
dear, O
but O
laughable, O
had O
recurred O
to O
her O
memory. O
Yes, O
she O
laughed O
and O
wept O
at O
the O
same O
time. O
What O
was O
I O
to O
do? O
I O
was O
like O
a O
man O
in O
a O
fever. O
I O
remember O
that O
she O
began O
to O
say O
something O
to O
me--though O
WHAT O
I O
do O
not O
know, O
since O
she O
spoke O
with O
a O
feverish O
lisp, O
as O
though O
she O
were O
trying O
to O
tell O
me O
something O
very O
quickly. O
At O
intervals, O
too, O
she O
would O
break O
off O
into O
the O
smile O
which O
I O
was O
beginning O
to O
dread. O
"No, O
no!" O
she O
kept O
repeating. O
"YOU O
are O
my O
dear O
one; O
YOU O
are O
the O
man O
I O
trust." O
Again O
she O
laid O
her O
hands O
upon O
my O
shoulders, O
and O
again O
she O
gazed O
at O
me O
as O
she O
reiterated: O
"You O
love O
me, O
you O
love O
me? O
Will O
you O
ALWAYS O
love O
me?" O
I O
could O
not O
take O
my O
eyes O
off O
her. O
Never O
before O
had O
I O
seen O
her O
in O
this O
mood O
of O
humility O
and O
affection. O
True, O
the O
mood O
was O
the O
outcome O
of O
hysteria; O
but--! O
All O
of O
a O
sudden O
she O
noticed O
my O
ardent O
gaze, O
and O
smiled O
slightly. O
The O
next O
moment, O
for O
no O
apparent O
reason, O
she O
began O
to O
talk O
of O
Astley. O
She O
continued O
talking O
and O
talking O
about O
him, O
but O
I O
could O
not O
make O
out O
all O
she O
said--more O
particularly O
when O
she O
was O
endeavouring O
to O
tell O
me O
of O
something O
or O
other O
which O
had O
happened O
recently. O
On O
the O
whole, O
she O
appeared O
to O
be O
laughing O
at O
Astley, O
for O
she O
kept O
repeating O
that O
he O
was O
waiting O
for O
her, O
and O
did O
I O
know O
whether, O
even O
at O
that O
moment, O
he O
was O
not O
standing O
beneath O
the O
window? O
"Yes, O
yes, O
he O
is O
there," O
she O
said. O
"Open O
the O
window, O
and O
see O
if O
he O
is O
not." O
She O
pushed O
me O
in O
that O
direction; O
yet, O
no O
sooner O
did O
I O
make O
a O
movement O
to O
obey O
her O
behest O
than O
she O
burst O
into O
laughter, O
and O
I O
remained O
beside O
her, O
and O
she O
embraced O
me. O
"Shall O
we O
go O
away O
tomorrow?" O
presently O
she O
asked, O
as O
though O
some O
disturbing O
thought O
had O
recurred O
to O
her O
recollection. O
"How O
would O
it O
be O
if O
we O
were O
to O
try O
and O
overtake O
Grandmamma? O
I O
think O
we O
should O
do O
so O
at O
Berlin. LOCATION
And O
what O
think O
you O
she O
would O
have O
to O
say O
to O
us O
when O
we O
caught O
her O
up, O
and O
her O
eyes O
first O
lit O
upon O
us? O
What, O
too, O
about O
Mr. O
Astley? O
HE O
would O
not O
leap O
from O
the O
Shlangenberg O
for O
my O
sake! O
No! O
Of O
that O
I O
am O
very O
sure!"--and O
she O
laughed. O
"Do O
you O
know O
where O
he O
is O
going O
next O
year? O
He O
says O
he O
intends O
to O
go O
to O
the O
North O
Pole O
for O
scientific O
investigations, O
and O
has O
invited O
me O
to O
go O
with O
him! O
Ha, O
ha, O
ha! O
He O
also O
says O
that O
we O
Russians O
know O
nothing, O
can O
do O
nothing, O
without O
European O
help. O
But O
he O
is O
a O
good O
fellow O
all O
the O
same. O
For O
instance, O
he O
does O
not O
blame O
the O
General O
in O
the O
matter, O
but O
declares O
that O
Mlle. O
Blanche--that O
love--But O
no; O
I O
do O
not O
know, O
I O
do O
not O
know." O
She O
stopped O
suddenly, O
as O
though O
she O
had O
said O
her O
say, O
and O
was O
feeling O
bewildered. O
"What O
poor O
creatures O
these O
people O
are. O
How O
sorry O
I O
am O
for O
them, O
and O
for O
Grandmamma! O
But O
when O
are O
you O
going O
to O
kill O
De O
Griers? O
Surely O
you O
do O
not O
intend O
actually O
to O
murder O
him? O
You O
fool! O
Do O
you O
suppose O
that O
I O
should O
ALLOW O
you O
to O
fight O
De O
Griers? O
Nor O
shall O
you O
kill O
the O
Baron." O
Here O
she O
burst O
out O
laughing. O
"How O
absurd O
you O
looked O
when O
you O
were O
talking O
to O
the O
Burmergelms! O
I O
was O
watching O
you O
all O
the O
time--watching O
you O
from O
where O
I O
was O
sitting. O
And O
how O
unwilling O
you O
were O
to O
go O
when O
I O
sent O
you! O
Oh, O
how O
I O
laughed O
and O
laughed!" O
Then O
she O
kissed O
and O
embraced O
me O
again; O
again O
she O
pressed O
her O
face O
to O
mine O
with O
tender O
passion. O
Yet O
I O
neither O
saw O
nor O
heard O
her, O
for O
my O
head O
was O
in O
a O
whirl.... O
It O
must O
have O
been O
about O
seven O
o'clock O
in O
the O
morning O
when O
I O
awoke. O
Daylight O
had O
come, O
and O
Polina PERSON
was O
sitting O
by O
my O
side--a O
strange O
expression O
on O
her O
face, O
as O
though O
she O
had O
seen O
a O
vision O
and O
was O
unable O
to O
collect O
her O
thoughts. O
She O
too O
had O
just O
awoken, O
and O
was O
now O
staring O
at O
the O
money O
on O
the O
table. O
My O
head O
ached; O
it O
felt O
heavy. O
I O
attempted O
to O
take O
Polina's O
hand, O
but O
she O
pushed O
me O
from O
her, O
and O
leapt O
from O
the O
sofa. O
The O
dawn O
was O
full O
of O
mist, O
for O
rain O
had O
fallen, O
yet O
she O
moved O
to O
the O
window, O
opened O
it, O
and, O
leaning O
her O
elbows O
upon O
the O
window-sill, O
thrust O
out O
her O
head O
and O
shoulders O
to O
take O
the O
air. O
In O
this O
position O
did O
she O
remain O
for O
several O
minutes, O
without O
ever O
looking O
round O
at O
me, O
or O
listening O
to O
what O
I O
was O
saying. O
Into O
my O
head O
there O
came O
the O
uneasy O
thought: O
What O
is O
to O
happen O
now? O
How O
is O
it O
all O
to O
end? O
Suddenly O
Polina PERSON
rose O
from O
the O
window, O
approached O
the O
table, O
and, O
looking O
at O
me O
with O
an O
expression O
of O
infinite O
aversion, O
said O
with O
lips O
which O
quivered O
with O
anger: O
"Well? O
Are O
you O
going O
to O
hand O
me O
over O
my O
fifty O
thousand O
francs?" O
"Polina, O
you O
say O
that O
AGAIN, O
AGAIN?" O
I O
exclaimed. O
"You O
have O
changed O
your O
mind, O
then? O
Ha, O
ha, O
ha! O
You O
are O
sorry O
you O
ever O
promised O
them?" O
On O
the O
table O
where, O
the O
previous O
night, O
I O
had O
counted O
the O
money O
there O
still O
was O
lying O
the O
packet O
of O
twenty O
five O
thousand O
florins. O
I O
handed O
it O
to O
her. O
"The O
francs O
are O
mine, O
then, O
are O
they? O
They O
are O
mine?" O
she O
inquired O
viciously O
as O
she O
balanced O
the O
money O
in O
her O
hands. O
"Yes; O
they O
have O
ALWAYS O
been O
yours," O
I O
said. O
"Then O
TAKE O
your O
fifty O
thousand O
francs!" O
and O
she O
hurled O
them O
full O
in O
my O
face. O
The O
packet O
burst O
as O
she O
did O
so, O
and O
the O
floor O
became O
strewed O
with O
bank-notes. O
The O
instant O
that O
the O
deed O
was O
done O
she O
rushed O
from O
the O
room. O
At O
that O
moment O
she O
cannot O
have O
been O
in O
her O
right O
mind; O
yet, O
what O
was O
the O
cause O
of O
her O
temporary O
aberration O
I O
cannot O
say. O
For O
a O
month O
past O
she O
had O
been O
unwell. O
Yet O
what O
had O
brought O
about O
this O
PRESENT O
condition O
of O
mind, O
above O
all O
things, O
this O
outburst? O
Had O
it O
come O
of O
wounded O
pride? O
Had O
it O
come O
of O
despair O
over O
her O
decision O
to O
come O
to O
me? O
Had O
it O
come O
of O
the O
fact O
that, O
presuming O
too O
much O
on O
my O
good O
fortune, O
I O
had O
seemed O
to O
be O
intending O
to O
desert O
her O
(even O
as O
De PERSON
Griers PERSON
had O
done) O
when O
once O
I O
had O
given O
her O
the O
fifty O
thousand O
francs? O
But, O
on O
my O
honour, O
I O
had O
never O
cherished O
any O
such O
intention. O
What O
was O
at O
fault, O
I O
think, O
was O
her O
own O
pride, O
which O
kept O
urging O
her O
not O
to O
trust O
me, O
but, O
rather, O
to O
insult O
me--even O
though O
she O
had O
not O
realised O
the O
fact. O
In O
her O
eyes O
I O
corresponded O
to O
De O
Griers, O
and O
therefore O
had O
been O
condemned O
for O
a O
fault O
not O
wholly O
my O
own. O
Her O
mood O
of O
late O
had O
been O
a O
sort O
of O
delirium, O
a O
sort O
of O
light-headedness--that O
I O
knew O
full O
well; O
yet, O
never O
had O
I O
sufficiently O
taken O
it O
into O
consideration. O
Perhaps O
she O
would O
not O
pardon O
me O
now? O
Ah, O
but O
this O
was O
THE O
PRESENT. O
What O
about O
the O
future? O
Her O
delirium O
and O
sickness O
were O
not O
likely O
to O
make O
her O
forget O
what O
she O
had O
done O
in O
bringing O
me O
De O
Griers' O
letter. O
No, O
she O
must O
have O
known O
what O
she O
was O
doing O
when O
she O
brought O
it. O
Somehow O
I O
contrived O
to O
stuff O
the O
pile O
of O
notes O
and O
gold O
under O
the O
bed, O
to O
cover O
them O
over, O
and O
then O
to O
leave O
the O
room O
some O
ten O
minutes O
after O
Polina. O
I O
felt O
sure O
that O
she O
had O
returned O
to O
her O
own O
room; O
wherefore, O
I O
intended O
quietly O
to O
follow O
her, O
and O
to O
ask O
the O
nursemaid O
aid O
who O
opened O
the O
door O
how O
her O
mistress O
was. O
Judge, O
therefore, O
of O
my O
surprise O
when, O
meeting O
the O
domestic O
on O
the O
stairs, O
she O
informed O
me O
that O
Polina PERSON
had O
not O
yet O
returned, O
and O
that O
she O
(the O
domestic) O
was O
at O
that O
moment O
on O
her O
way O
to O
my O
room O
in O
quest O
of O
her! O
"Mlle. O
left O
me O
but O
ten O
minutes O
ago," O
I O
said. O
"What O
can O
have O
become O
of O
her?" O
The O
nursemaid O
looked O
at O
me O
reproachfully. O
Already O
sundry O
rumours O
were O
flying O
about O
the O
hotel. O
Both O
in O
the O
office O
of O
the O
commissionaire O
and O
in O
that O
of O
the O
landlord O
it O
was O
whispered O
that, O
at O
seven O
o'clock O
that O
morning, O
the O
Fraulein PERSON
had O
left O
the O
hotel, O
and O
set O
off, O
despite O
the O
rain, O
in O
the O
direction O
of O
the O
Hotel O
d'Angleterre. O
From O
words O
and O
hints O
let O
fall O
I O
could O
see O
that O
the O
fact O
of O
Polina PERSON
having O
spent O
the O
night O
in O
my O
room O
was O
now O
public O
property. O
Also, O
sundry O
rumours O
were O
circulating O
concerning O
the O
General's O
family O
affairs. O
It O
was O
known O
that O
last O
night O
he O
had O
gone O
out O
of O
his O
mind, O
and O
paraded O
the O
hotel O
in O
tears; O
also, O
that O
the O
old O
lady O
who O
had O
arrived O
was O
his O
mother, O
and O
that O
she O
had O
come O
from O
Russia LOCATION
on O
purpose O
to O
forbid O
her O
son's O
marriage O
with O
Mlle. O
de O
Cominges, O
as O
well O
as O
to O
cut O
him O
out O
of O
her O
will O
if O
he O
should O
disobey O
her; O
also O
that, O
because O
he O
had O
disobeyed O
her, O
she O
had O
squandered O
all O
her O
money O
at O
roulette, O
in O
order O
to O
have O
nothing O
more O
to O
leave O
to O
him. O
"Oh, O
these O
Russians!" O
exclaimed O
the O
landlord, O
with O
an O
angry O
toss O
of O
the O
head, O
while O
the O
bystanders O
laughed O
and O
the O
clerk O
betook O
himself O
to O
his O
accounts. O
Also, O
every O
one O
had O
learnt O
about O
my O
winnings; O
Karl, O
the O
corridor O
lacquey, O
was O
the O
first O
to O
congratulate O
me. O
But O
with O
these O
folk O
I O
had O
nothing O
to O
do. O
My O
business O
was O
to O
set O
off O
at O
full O
speed O
to O
the O
Hotel O
d'Angleterre. O
As O
yet O
it O
was O
early O
for O
Mr. O
Astley PERSON
to O
receive O
visitors; O
but, O
as O
soon O
as O
he O
learnt O
that O
it O
was O
I O
who O
had O
arrived, O
he O
came O
out O
into O
the O
corridor O
to O
meet O
me, O
and O
stood O
looking O
at O
me O
in O
silence O
with O
his O
steel-grey O
eyes O
as O
he O
waited O
to O
hear O
what O
I O
had O
to O
say. O
I O
inquired O
after O
Polina. O
"She O
is O
ill," O
he O
replied, O
still O
looking O
at O
me O
with O
his O
direct, O
unwavering O
glance. O
"And O
she O
is O
in O
your O
rooms." O
"Yes, O
she O
is O
in O
my O
rooms." O
"Then O
you O
are O
minded O
to O
keep O
her O
there?" O
"Yes, O
I O
am O
minded O
to O
keep O
her O
there." O
"But, O
Mr. O
Astley, O
that O
will O
raise O
a O
scandal. O
It O
ought O
not O
to O
be O
allowed. O
Besides, O
she O
is O
very O
ill. O
Perhaps O
you O
had O
not O
remarked O
that?" O
"Yes, O
I O
have. O
It O
was O
I O
who O
told O
you O
about O
it. O
Had O
she O
not O
been O
ill, O
she O
would O
not O
have O
gone O
and O
spent O
the O
night O
with O
you." O
"Then O
you O
know O
all O
about O
it?" O
"Yes; O
for O
last O
night O
she O
was O
to O
have O
accompanied O
me O
to O
the O
house O
of O
a O
relative O
of O
mine. O
Unfortunately, O
being O
ill, O
she O
made O
a O
mistake, O
and O
went O
to O
your O
rooms O
instead." O
"Indeed? O
Then O
I O
wish O
you O
joy, O
Mr. O
Astley. O
Apropos, O
you O
have O
reminded O
me O
of O
something. O
Were O
you O
beneath O
my O
window O
last O
night? O
Every O
moment O
Mlle. O
Polina PERSON
kept O
telling O
me O
to O
open O
the O
window O
and O
see O
if O
you O
were O
there; O
after O
which O
she O
always O
smiled." O
"Indeed? O
No, O
I O
was O
not O
there; O
but O
I O
was O
waiting O
in O
the O
corridor, O
and O
walking O
about O
the O
hotel." O
"She O
ought O
to O
see O
a O
doctor, O
you O
know, O
Mr. O
Astley." O
"Yes, O
she O
ought. O
I O
have O
sent O
for O
one, O
and, O
if O
she O
dies, O
I O
shall O
hold O
you O
responsible." O
This O
surprised O
me. O
"Pardon O
me," O
I O
replied, O
"but O
what O
do O
you O
mean?" O
"Never O
mind. O
Tell O
me O
if O
it O
is O
true O
that, O
last O
night, O
you O
won O
two O
hundred O
thousand O
thalers?" O
"No; O
I O
won O
a O
hundred O
thousand O
florins." O
"Good O
heavens! O
Then O
I O
suppose O
you O
will O
be O
off O
to O
Paris LOCATION
this O
morning? O
"Why?" O
"Because O
all O
Russians O
who O
have O
grown O
rich O
go O
to O
Paris," O
explained O
Astley, O
as O
though O
he O
had O
read O
the O
fact O
in O
a O
book. O
"But O
what O
could O
I O
do O
in O
Paris LOCATION
in O
summer O
time?--I O
LOVE O
her, O
Mr. O
Astley! O
Surely O
you O
know O
that?" O
"Indeed? O
I O
am O
sure O
that O
you O
do O
NOT. O
Moreover, O
if O
you O
were O
to O
stay O
here, O
you O
would O
lose O
everything O
that O
you O
possess, O
and O
have O
nothing O
left O
with O
which O
to O
pay O
your O
expenses O
in O
Paris. O
Well, O
good-bye O
now. O
I O
feel O
sure O
that O
today O
will O
see O
you O
gone O
from O
here." O
"Good-bye. O
But O
I O
am O
NOT O
going O
to O
Paris. O
Likewise--pardon O
me--what O
is O
to O
become O
of O
this O
family? O
I O
mean O
that O
the O
affair O
of O
the O
General O
and O
Mlle. O
Polina PERSON
will O
soon O
be O
all O
over O
the O
town." O
"I O
daresay; O
yet, O
I O
hardly O
suppose O
that O
that O
will O
break O
the O
General's O
heart. O
Moreover, O
Mlle. O
Polina PERSON
has O
a O
perfect O
right O
to O
live O
where O
she O
chooses. O
In O
short, O
we O
may O
say O
that, O
as O
a O
family, O
this O
family O
has O
ceased O
to O
exist." O
I O
departed, O
and O
found O
myself O
smiling O
at O
the O
Englishman's O
strange O
assurance O
that O
I O
should O
soon O
be O
leaving O
for O
Paris. O
"I O
suppose O
he O
means O
to O
shoot O
me O
in O
a O
duel, O
should O
Polina PERSON
die. O
Yes, O
that O
is O
what O
he O
intends O
to O
do." O
Now, O
although O
I O
was O
honestly O
sorry O
for O
Polina, O
it O
is O
a O
fact O
that, O
from O
the O
moment O
when, O
the O
previous O
night, O
I O
had O
approached O
the O
gaming-table, O
and O
begun O
to O
rake O
in O
the O
packets O
of O
bank-notes, O
my O
love O
for O
her O
had O
entered O
upon O
a O
new O
plane. O
Yes, O
I O
can O
say O
that O
now; O
although, O
at O
the O
time, O
I O
was O
barely O
conscious O
of O
it. O
Was O
I, O
then, O
at O
heart O
a O
gambler? O
Did O
I, O
after O
all, O
love O
Polina PERSON
not O
so O
very O
much? O
No, O
no! O
As O
God O
is O
my O
witness, O
I O
loved O
her! O
Even O
when O
I O
was O
returning O
home O
from O
Mr. O
Astley's O
my O
suffering O
was O
genuine, O
and O
my O
self-reproach O
sincere. O
But O
presently O
I O
was O
to O
go O
through O
an O
exceedingly O
strange O
and O
ugly O
experience. O
I O
was O
proceeding O
to O
the O
General's O
rooms O
when O
I O
heard O
a O
door O
near O
me O
open, O
and O
a O
voice O
call O
me O
by O
name. O
It O
was O
Mlle.'s O
mother, O
the O
Widow O
de O
Cominges O
who O
was O
inviting O
me, O
in O
her O
daughter's O
name, O
to O
enter. O
I O
did O
so; O
whereupon, O
I O
heard O
a O
laugh O
and O
a O
little O
cry O
proceed O
from O
the O
bedroom O
(the O
pair O
occupied O
a O
suite O
of O
two O
apartments), O
where O
Mlle. O
Blanche PERSON
was O
just O
arising. O
"Ah, O
c'est O
lui! O
Viens, O
donc, O
bete! O
Is O
it O
true O
that O
you O
have O
won O
a O
mountain O
of O
gold O
and O
silver? O
J'aimerais O
mieux O
l'or." O
"Yes," O
I O
replied O
with O
a O
smile. O
"How O
much?" O
"A O
hundred O
thousand O
florins." O
"Bibi, O
comme O
tu O
es O
bete! O
Come O
in O
here, O
for O
I O
can't O
hear O
you O
where O
you O
are O
now. O
Nous O
ferons O
bombance, O
n'est-ce O
pas?" O
Entering O
her O
room, O
I O
found O
her O
lolling O
under O
a O
pink O
satin O
coverlet, O
and O
revealing O
a O
pair O
of O
swarthy, O
wonderfully O
healthy O
shoulders--shoulders O
such O
as O
one O
sees O
in O
dreams--shoulders O
covered O
over O
with O
a O
white O
cambric O
nightgown O
which, O
trimmed O
with O
lace, O
stood O
out, O
in O
striking O
relief, O
against O
the O
darkness O
of O
her O
skin. O
"Mon O
fils, O
as-tu O
du O
coeur?" O
she O
cried O
when O
she O
saw O
me, O
and O
then O
giggled. O
Her O
laugh O
had O
always O
been O
a O
very O
cheerful O
one, O
and O
at O
times O
it O
even O
sounded O
sincere. O
"Tout O
autre--" O
I O
began, O
paraphrasing O
Corneille. O
"See O
here," O
she O
prattled O
on. O
"Please O
search O
for O
my O
stockings, O
and O
help O
me O
to O
dress. O
Aussi, O
si O
tu O
n'es O
pas O
trop O
bete O
je O
te O
prends O
a O
Paris. O
I O
am O
just O
off, O
let O
me O
tell O
you." O
"This O
moment?" O
"In O
half O
an O
hour." O
True O
enough, O
everything O
stood O
ready-packed--trunks, O
portmanteaux, O
and O
all. O
Coffee O
had O
long O
been O
served. O
"Eh O
bien, O
tu O
verras O
Paris. O
Dis O
donc, O
qu'est-ce O
que O
c'est O
qu'un O
'utchitel'? O
Tu O
etais O
bien O
bete O
quand O
tu O
etais O
'utchitel.' O
Where O
are O
my O
stockings? O
Please O
help O
me O
to O
dress." O
And O
she O
lifted O
up O
a O
really O
ravishing O
foot--small, O
swarthy, O
and O
not O
misshapen O
like O
the O
majority O
of O
feet O
which O
look O
dainty O
only O
in O
bottines. O
I O
laughed, O
and O
started O
to O
draw O
on O
to O
the O
foot O
a O
silk O
stocking, O
while O
Mlle. O
Blanche PERSON
sat O
on O
the O
edge O
of O
the O
bed O
and O
chattered. O
"Eh O
bien, O
que O
feras-tu O
si O
je O
te O
prends O
avec O
moi? O
First O
of O
all O
I O
must O
have O
fifty O
thousand O
francs, O
and O
you O
shall O
give O
them O
to O
me O
at O
Frankfurt. O
Then O
we O
will O
go O
on O
to O
Paris, O
where O
we O
will O
live O
together, O
et O
je O
te O
ferai O
voir O
des O
etoiles O
en O
plein O
jour. O
Yes, O
you O
shall O
see O
such O
women O
as O
your O
eyes O
have O
never O
lit O
upon." O
"Stop O
a O
moment. O
If O
I O
were O
to O
give O
you O
those O
fifty O
thousand O
francs, O
what O
should O
I O
have O
left O
for O
myself?" O
"Another O
hundred O
thousand O
francs, O
please O
to O
remember. O
Besides, O
I O
could O
live O
with O
you O
in O
your O
rooms O
for O
a O
month, O
or O
even O
for O
two; O
or O
even O
for O
longer. O
But O
it O
would O
not O
take O
us O
more O
than O
two O
months O
to O
get O
through O
fifty O
thousand O
francs; O
for, O
look O
you, O
je O
suis O
bonne O
enfante, O
et O
tu O
verras O
des O
etoiles, O
you O
may O
be O
sure." O
"What? O
You O
mean O
to O
say O
that O
we O
should O
spend O
the O
whole O
in O
two O
months?" O
"Certainly. O
Does O
that O
surprise O
you O
very O
much? O
Ah, O
vil O
esclave! O
Why, O
one O
month O
of O
that O
life O
would O
be O
better O
than O
all O
your O
previous O
existence. O
One O
month--et O
apres, O
le O
deluge! O
Mais O
tu O
ne O
peux O
comprendre. O
Va! O
Away, O
away! O
You O
are O
not O
worth O
it.--Ah, O
que O
fais-tu?" O
For, O
while O
drawing O
on O
the O
other O
stocking, O
I O
had O
felt O
constrained O
to O
kiss O
her. O
Immediately O
she O
shrunk O
back, O
kicked O
me O
in O
the O
face O
with O
her O
toes, O
and O
turned O
me O
neck O
and O
prop O
out O
of O
the O
room. O
"Eh O
bien, O
mon O
'utchitel'," O
she O
called O
after O
me, O
"je O
t'attends, O
si O
tu O
veux. O
I O
start O
in O
a O
quarter O
of O
an O
hour's O
time." O
I O
returned O
to O
my O
own O
room O
with O
my O
head O
in O
a O
whirl. O
It O
was O
not O
my O
fault O
that O
Polina PERSON
had O
thrown O
a O
packet O
in O
my O
face, O
and O
preferred O
Mr. O
Astley PERSON
to O
myself. O
A O
few O
bank-notes O
were O
still O
fluttering O
about O
the O
floor, O
and O
I O
picked O
them O
up. O
At O
that O
moment O
the O
door O
opened, O
and O
the O
landlord O
appeared--a O
person O
who, O
until O
now, O
had O
never O
bestowed O
upon O
me O
so O
much O
as O
a O
glance. O
He O
had O
come O
to O
know O
if O
I O
would O
prefer O
to O
move O
to O
a O
lower O
floor--to O
a O
suite O
which O
had O
just O
been O
tenanted O
by O
Count O
V. O
For O
a O
moment O
I O
reflected. O
"No!" O
I O
shouted. O
"My O
account, O
please, O
for O
in O
ten O
minutes O
I O
shall O
be O
gone." O
"To O
Paris, O
to O
Paris!" O
I O
added O
to O
myself. O
"Every O
man O
of O
birth O
must O
make O
her O
acquaintance." O
Within O
a O
quarter O
of O
an O
hour O
all O
three O
of O
us O
were O
seated O
in O
a O
family O
compartment--Mlle. O
Blanche, O
the O
Widow O
de O
Cominges, O
and O
myself. O
Mlle. O
kept O
laughing O
hysterically O
as O
she O
looked O
at O
me, O
and O
Madame O
re-echoed O
her; O
but O
I O
did O
not O
feel O
so O
cheerful. O
My O
life O
had O
broken O
in O
two, O
and O
yesterday O
had O
infected O
me O
with O
a O
habit O
of O
staking O
my O
all O
upon O
a O
card. O
Although O
it O
might O
be O
that O
I O
had O
failed O
to O
win O
my O
stake, O
that O
I O
had O
lost O
my O
senses, O
that O
I O
desired O
nothing O
better, O
I O
felt O
that O
the O
scene O
was O
to O
be O
changed O
only O
FOR O
A O
TIME. O
"Within O
a O
month O
from O
now," O
I O
kept O
thinking O
to O
myself, O
"I O
shall O
be O
back O
again O
in O
Roulettenberg; O
and O
THEN O
I O
mean O
to O
have O
it O
out O
with O
you, O
Mr. O
Astley!" O
Yes, O
as O
now O
I O
look O
back O
at O
things, O
I O
remember O
that O
I O
felt O
greatly O
depressed, O
despite O
the O
absurd O
gigglings O
of O
the O
egregious O
Blanche. O
"What O
is O
the O
matter O
with O
you? O
How O
dull O
you O
are!" O
she O
cried O
at O
length O
as O
she O
interrupted O
her O
laughter O
to O
take O
me O
seriously O
to O
task. O
"Come, O
come! O
We O
are O
going O
to O
spend O
your O
two O
hundred O
thousand O
francs O
for O
you, O
et O
tu O
seras O
heureux O
comme O
un O
petit O
roi. O
I O
myself O
will O
tie O
your O
tie O
for O
you, O
and O
introduce O
you O
to O
Hortense. O
And O
when O
we O
have O
spent O
your O
money O
you O
shall O
return O
here, O
and O
break O
the O
bank O
again. O
What O
did O
those O
two O
Jews O
tell O
you?--that O
the O
thing O
most O
needed O
is O
daring, O
and O
that O
you O
possess O
it? O
Consequently, O
this O
is O
not O
the O
first O
time O
that O
you O
will O
be O
hurrying O
to O
Paris LOCATION
with O
money O
in O
your O
pocket. O
Quant O
... O
moi, O
je O
veux O
cinquante O
mille O
francs O
de O
rente, O
et O
alors." O
"But O
what O
about O
the O
General?" O
I O
interrupted. O
"The O
General? O
You O
know O
well O
enough O
that O
at O
about O
this O
hour O
every O
day O
he O
goes O
to O
buy O
me O
a O
bouquet. O
On O
this O
occasion, O
I O
took O
care O
to O
tell O
him O
that O
he O
must O
hunt O
for O
the O
choicest O
of O
flowers; O
and O
when O
he O
returns O
home, O
the O
poor O
fellow O
will O
find O
the O
bird O
flown. O
Possibly O
he O
may O
take O
wing O
in O
pursuit--ha, O
ha, O
ha! O
And O
if O
so, O
I O
shall O
not O
be O
sorry, O
for O
he O
could O
be O
useful O
to O
me O
in O
Paris, O
and O
Mr. O
Astley PERSON
will O
pay O
his O
debts O
here." O
In O
this O
manner O
did O
I O
depart O
for O
the O
Gay O
City. O
XVI O
Of O
Paris LOCATION
what O
am O
I O
to O
say? O
The O
whole O
proceeding O
was O
a O
delirium, O
a O
madness. O
I O
spent O
a O
little O
over O
three O
weeks O
there, O
and, O
during O
that O
time, O
saw O
my O
hundred O
thousand O
francs O
come O
to O
an O
end. O
I O
speak O
only O
of O
the O
ONE O
hundred O
thousand O
francs, O
for O
the O
other O
hundred O
thousand O
I O
gave O
to O
Mlle. O
Blanche O
in O
pure O
cash. O
That O
is O
to O
say, O
I O
handed O
her O
fifty O
thousand O
francs O
at O
Frankfurt, O
and, O
three O
days O
later O
(in O
Paris), O
advanced O
her O
another O
fifty O
thousand O
on O
note O
of O
hand. O
Nevertheless, O
a O
week O
had O
not O
elapsed O
ere O
she O
came O
to O
me O
for O
more O
money. O
"Et O
les O
cent O
mille O
francs O
qui O
nous O
restent," O
she O
added, O
"tu O
les O
mangeras O
avec O
moi, O
mon O
utchitel." O
Yes, O
she O
always O
called O
me O
her O
"utchitel." O
A O
person O
more O
economical, O
grasping, O
and O
mean O
than O
Mlle. O
Blanche O
one O
could O
not O
imagine. O
But O
this O
was O
only O
as O
regards O
HER O
OWN O
money. O
MY O
hundred O
thousand O
francs O
(as O
she O
explained O
to O
me O
later) O
she O
needed O
to O
set O
up O
her O
establishment O
in O
Paris, O
"so O
that O
once O
and O
for O
all O
I O
may O
be O
on O
a O
decent O
footing, O
and O
proof O
against O
any O
stones O
which O
may O
be O
thrown O
at O
me--at O
all O
events O
for O
a O
long O
time O
to O
come." O
Nevertheless, O
I O
saw O
nothing O
of O
those O
hundred O
thousand O
francs, O
for O
my O
own O
purse O
(which O
she O
inspected O
daily) O
never O
managed O
to O
amass O
in O
it O
more O
than O
a O
hundred O
francs O
at O
a O
time; O
and, O
generally O
the O
sum O
did O
not O
reach O
even O
that O
figure. O
"What O
do O
you O
want O
with O
money?" O
she O
would O
say O
to O
me O
with O
air O
of O
absolute O
simplicity; O
and O
I O
never O
disputed O
the O
point. O
Nevertheless, O
though O
she O
fitted O
out O
her O
flat O
very O
badly O
with O
the O
money, O
the O
fact O
did O
not O
prevent O
her O
from O
saying O
when, O
later, O
she O
was O
showing O
me O
over O
the O
rooms O
of O
her O
new O
abode: O
"See O
what O
care O
and O
taste O
can O
do O
with O
the O
most O
wretched O
of O
means!" O
However, O
her O
"wretchedness" O
had O
cost O
fifty O
thousand O
francs, O
while O
with O
the O
remaining O
fifty O
thousand O
she O
purchased O
a O
carriage O
and O
horses. O
Also, O
we O
gave O
a O
couple O
of O
balls--evening O
parties O
attended O
by O
Hortense PERSON
and O
Lisette PERSON
and O
Cleopatre, O
who O
were O
women O
remarkable O
both O
for O
the O
number O
of O
their O
liaisons O
and O
(though O
only O
in O
some O
cases) O
for O
their O
good O
looks. O
At O
these O
reunions O
I O
had O
to O
play O
the O
part O
of O
host--to O
meet O
and O
entertain O
fat O
mercantile O
parvenus O
who O
were O
impossible O
by O
reason O
of O
their O
rudeness O
and O
braggadocio, O
colonels O
of O
various O
kinds, O
hungry O
authors, O
and O
journalistic O
hacks--all O
of O
whom O
disported O
themselves O
in O
fashionable O
tailcoats O
and O
pale O
yellow O
gloves, O
and O
displayed O
such O
an O
aggregate O
of O
conceit O
and O
gasconade O
as O
would O
be O
unthinkable O
even O
in O
St. LOCATION
Petersburg--which LOCATION
is O
saying O
a O
great O
deal! O
They O
used O
to O
try O
to O
make O
fun O
of O
me, O
but O
I O
would O
console O
myself O
by O
drinking O
champagne O
and O
then O
lolling O
in O
a O
retiring-room. O
Nevertheless, O
I O
found O
it O
deadly O
work. O
"C'est O
un O
utchitel," O
Blanche O
would O
say O
of O
me, O
"qui O
a O
gagne O
deux O
cent O
mille O
francs, O
and O
but O
for O
me, O
would O
have O
had O
not O
a O
notion O
how O
to O
spend O
them. O
Presently O
he O
will O
have O
to O
return O
to O
his O
tutoring. O
Does O
any O
one O
know O
of O
a O
vacant O
post? O
You O
know, O
one O
must O
do O
something O
for O
him." O
I O
had O
the O
more O
frequent O
recourse O
to O
champagne O
in O
that O
I O
constantly O
felt O
depressed O
and O
bored, O
owing O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
I O
was O
living O
in O
the O
most O
bourgeois O
commercial O
milieu O
imaginable--a O
milieu O
wherein O
every O
sou O
was O
counted O
and O
grudged. O
Indeed, O
two O
weeks O
had O
not O
elapsed O
before O
I O
perceived O
that O
Blanche PERSON
had O
no O
real O
affection O
for O
me, O
even O
though O
she O
dressed O
me O
in O
elegant O
clothes, O
and O
herself O
tied O
my O
tie O
each O
day. O
In O
short, O
she O
utterly O
despised O
me. O
But O
that O
caused O
me O
no O
concern. O
Blase O
and O
inert, O
I O
spent O
my O
evenings O
generally O
at O
the O
Chateau O
des O
Fleurs, O
where O
I O
would O
get O
fuddled O
and O
then O
dance O
the O
cancan O
(which, O
in O
that O
establishment, O
was O
a O
very O
indecent O
performance) O
with O
eclat. O
At O
length, O
the O
time O
came O
when O
Blanche PERSON
had O
drained O
my O
purse O
dry. O
She O
had O
conceived O
an O
idea O
that, O
during O
the O
term O
of O
our O
residence O
together, O
it O
would O
be O
well O
if O
I O
were O
always O
to O
walk O
behind O
her O
with O
a O
paper O
and O
pencil, O
in O
order O
to O
jot O
down O
exactly O
what O
she O
spent, O
what O
she O
had O
saved, O
what O
she O
was O
paying O
out, O
and O
what O
she O
was O
laying O
by. O
Well, O
of O
course O
I O
could O
not O
fail O
to O
be O
aware O
that O
this O
would O
entail O
a O
battle O
over O
every O
ten O
francs; O
so, O
although O
for O
every O
possible O
objection O
that O
I O
might O
make O
she O
had O
prepared O
a O
suitable O
answer, O
she O
soon O
saw O
that O
I O
made O
no O
objections, O
and O
therefore, O
had O
to O
start O
disputes O
herself. O
That O
is O
to O
say, O
she O
would O
burst O
out O
into O
tirades O
which O
were O
met O
only O
with O
silence O
as O
I O
lolled O
on O
a O
sofa O
and O
stared O
fixedly O
at O
the O
ceiling. O
This O
greatly O
surprised O
her. O
At O
first O
she O
imagined O
that O
it O
was O
due O
merely O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
I O
was O
a O
fool, O
"un O
utchitel"; O
wherefore O
she O
would O
break O
off O
her O
harangue O
in O
the O
belief O
that, O
being O
too O
stupid O
to O
understand, O
I O
was O
a O
hopeless O
case. O
Then O
she O
would O
leave O
the O
room, O
but O
return O
ten O
minutes O
later O
to O
resume O
the O
contest. O
This O
continued O
throughout O
her O
squandering O
of O
my O
money--a O
squandering O
altogether O
out O
of O
proportion O
to O
our O
means. O
An O
example O
is O
the O
way O
in O
which O
she O
changed O
her O
first O
pair O
of O
horses O
for O
a O
pair O
which O
cost O
sixteen O
thousand O
francs. O
"Bibi," O
she O
said O
on O
the O
latter O
occasion O
as O
she O
approached O
me, O
"surely O
you O
are O
not O
angry?" O
"No-o-o: O
I O
am O
merely O
tired," O
was O
my O
reply O
as O
I O
pushed O
her O
from O
me. O
This O
seemed O
to O
her O
so O
curious O
that O
straightway O
she O
seated O
herself O
by O
my O
side. O
"You O
see," O
she O
went O
on, O
"I O
decided O
to O
spend O
so O
much O
upon O
these O
horses O
only O
because O
I O
can O
easily O
sell O
them O
again. O
They O
would O
go O
at O
any O
time O
for O
TWENTY O
thousand O
francs." O
"Yes, O
yes. O
They O
are O
splendid O
horses, O
and O
you O
have O
got O
a O
splendid O
turn-out. O
I O
am O
quite O
content. O
Let O
me O
hear O
no O
more O
of O
the O
matter." O
"Then O
you O
are O
not O
angry?" O
"No. O
Why O
should O
I O
be? O
You O
are O
wise O
to O
provide O
yourself O
with O
what O
you O
need, O
for O
it O
will O
all O
come O
in O
handy O
in O
the O
future. O
Yes, O
I O
quite O
see O
the O
necessity O
of O
your O
establishing O
yourself O
on O
a O
good O
basis, O
for O
without O
it O
you O
will O
never O
earn O
your O
million. O
My O
hundred O
thousand O
francs O
I O
look O
upon O
merely O
as O
a O
beginning--as O
a O
mere O
drop O
in O
the O
bucket." O
Blanche, O
who O
had O
by O
no O
means O
expected O
such O
declarations O
from O
me, O
but, O
rather, O
an O
uproar O
and O
protests, O
was O
rather O
taken O
aback. O
"Well, O
well, O
what O
a O
man O
you O
are!" O
she O
exclaimed. O
"Mais O
tu O
as O
l'esprit O
pour O
comprendre. O
Sais-tu, O
mon O
garcon, O
although O
you O
are O
a O
tutor, O
you O
ought O
to O
have O
been O
born O
a O
prince. O
Are O
you O
not O
sorry O
that O
your O
money O
should O
be O
going O
so O
quickly?" O
"No. O
The O
quicker O
it O
goes O
the O
better." O
"Mais--sais-tu-mais O
dis O
donc, O
are O
you O
really O
rich? O
Mais O
sais-tu, O
you O
have O
too O
much O
contempt O
for O
money. O
Qu'est-ce O
que O
tu O
feras O
apres, O
dis O
donc?" O
"Apres O
I O
shall O
go O
to O
Homburg, O
and O
win O
another O
hundred O
thousand O
francs." O
"Oui, O
oui, O
c'est O
ca, O
c'est O
magnifique! O
Ah, O
I O
know O
you O
will O
win O
them, O
and O
bring O
them O
to O
me O
when O
you O
have O
done O
so. O
Dis O
donc--you O
will O
end O
by O
making O
me O
love O
you. O
Since O
you O
are O
what O
you O
are, O
I O
mean O
to O
love O
you O
all O
the O
time, O
and O
never O
to O
be O
unfaithful O
to O
you. O
You O
see, O
I O
have O
not O
loved O
you O
before O
parce O
que O
je O
croyais O
que O
tu O
n'es O
qu'un O
utchitel O
(quelque O
chose O
comme O
un O
lacquais, O
n'est-ce O
pas?) O
Yet O
all O
the O
time O
I O
have O
been O
true O
to O
you, O
parce O
que O
je O
suis O
bonne O
fille." O
"You O
lie!" O
I O
interrupted. O
"Did O
I O
not O
see O
you, O
the O
other O
day, O
with O
Albert--with O
that O
black-jowled O
officer?" O
"Oh, O
oh! O
Mais O
tu O
es--" O
"Yes, O
you O
are O
lying O
right O
enough. O
But O
what O
makes O
you O
suppose O
that O
I O
should O
be O
angry? O
Rubbish! O
Il O
faut O
que O
jeunesse O
se O
passe. O
Even O
if O
that O
officer O
were O
here O
now, O
I O
should O
refrain O
from O
putting O
him O
out O
of O
the O
room O
if O
I O
thought O
you O
really O
cared O
for O
him. O
Only, O
mind O
you, O
do O
not O
give O
him O
any O
of O
my O
money. O
You O
hear?" O
"You O
say, O
do O
you, O
that O
you O
would O
not O
be O
angry? O
Mais O
tu O
es O
un O
vrai O
philosophe, O
sais-tu? O
Oui, O
un O
vrai O
philosophe! O
Eh O
bien, O
je O
t'aimerai, O
je O
t'aimerai. O
Tu O
verras-tu O
seras O
content." O
True O
enough, O
from O
that O
time O
onward O
she O
seemed O
to O
attach O
herself O
only O
to O
me, O
and O
in O
this O
manner O
we O
spent O
our O
last O
ten O
days O
together. O
The O
promised O
"etoiles" O
I O
did O
not O
see, O
but O
in O
other O
respects O
she, O
to O
a O
certain O
extent, O
kept O
her O
word. O
Moreover, O
she O
introduced O
me O
to O
Hortense, O
who O
was O
a O
remarkable O
woman O
in O
her O
way, O
and O
known O
among O
us O
as O
Therese PERSON
Philosophe. O
But O
I O
need O
not O
enlarge O
further, O
for O
to O
do O
so O
would O
require O
a O
story O
to O
itself, O
and O
entail O
a O
colouring O
which O
I O
am O
loth O
to O
impart O
to O
the O
present O
narrative. O
The O
point O
is O
that O
with O
all O
my O
faculties O
I O
desired O
the O
episode O
to O
come O
to O
an O
end O
as O
speedily O
as O
possible. O
Unfortunately, O
our O
hundred O
thousand O
francs O
lasted O
us, O
as O
I O
have O
said, O
for O
very O
nearly O
a O
month--which O
greatly O
surprised O
me. O
At O
all O
events, O
Blanche O
bought O
herself O
articles O
to O
the O
tune O
of O
eighty O
thousand O
francs, O
and O
the O
rest O
sufficed O
just O
to O
meet O
our O
expenses O
of O
living. O
Towards O
the O
close O
of O
the O
affair, O
Blanche O
grew O
almost O
frank O
with O
me O
(at O
least, O
she O
scarcely O
lied O
to O
me O
at O
all)--declaring, O
amongst O
other O
things, O
that O
none O
of O
the O
debts O
which O
she O
had O
been O
obliged O
to O
incur O
were O
going O
to O
fall O
upon O
my O
head. O
"I O
have O
purposely O
refrained O
from O
making O
you O
responsible O
for O
my O
bills O
or O
borrowings," O
she O
said, O
"for O
the O
reason O
that O
I O
am O
sorry O
for O
you. O
Any O
other O
woman O
in O
my O
place O
would O
have O
done O
so, O
and O
have O
let O
you O
go O
to O
prison. O
See, O
then, O
how O
much O
I O
love O
you, O
and O
how O
good-hearted O
I O
am! O
Think, O
too, O
what O
this O
accursed O
marriage O
with O
the O
General O
is O
going O
to O
cost O
me!" O
True O
enough, O
the O
marriage O
took O
place. O
It O
did O
so O
at O
the O
close O
of O
our O
month O
together, O
and O
I O
am O
bound O
to O
suppose O
that O
it O
was O
upon O
the O
ceremony O
that O
the O
last O
remnants O
of O
my O
money O
were O
spent. O
With O
it O
the O
episode--that O
is O
to O
say, O
my O
sojourn O
with O
the O
Frenchwoman--came O
to O
an O
end, O
and O
I O
formally O
retired O
from O
the O
scene. O
It O
happened O
thus: O
A O
week O
after O
we O
had O
taken O
up O
our O
abode O
in O
Paris LOCATION
there O
arrived O
thither O
the O
General. O
He O
came O
straight O
to O
see O
us, O
and O
thenceforward O
lived O
with O
us O
practically O
as O
our O
guest, O
though O
he O
had O
a O
flat O
of O
his O
own O
as O
well. O
Blanche PERSON
met O
him O
with O
merry O
badinage O
and O
laughter, O
and O
even O
threw O
her O
arms O
around O
him. O
In O
fact, O
she O
managed O
it O
so O
that O
he O
had O
to O
follow O
everywhere O
in O
her O
train--whether O
when O
promenading O
on O
the O
Boulevards, O
or O
when O
driving, O
or O
when O
going O
to O
the O
theatre, O
or O
when O
paying O
calls; O
and O
this O
use O
which O
she O
made O
of O
him O
quite O
satisfied O
the O
General. O
Still O
of O
imposing O
appearance O
and O
presence, O
as O
well O
as O
of O
fair O
height, O
he O
had O
a O
dyed O
moustache O
and O
whiskers O
(he O
had O
formerly O
been O
in O
the O
cuirassiers), O
and O
a O
handsome, O
though O
a O
somewhat O
wrinkled, O
face. O
Also, O
his O
manners O
were O
excellent, O
and O
he O
could O
carry O
a O
frockcoat O
well--the O
more O
so O
since, O
in O
Paris, O
he O
took O
to O
wearing O
his O
orders. O
To O
promenade O
the O
Boulevards O
with O
such O
a O
man O
was O
not O
only O
a O
thing O
possible, O
but O
also, O
so O
to O
speak, O
a O
thing O
advisable, O
and O
with O
this O
programme O
the O
good O
but O
foolish O
General O
had O
not O
a O
fault O
to O
find. O
The O
truth O
is O
that O
he O
had O
never O
counted O
upon O
this O
programme O
when O
he O
came O
to O
Paris LOCATION
to O
seek O
us O
out. O
On O
that O
occasion O
he O
had O
made O
his O
appearance O
nearly O
shaking O
with O
terror, O
for O
he O
had O
supposed O
that O
Blanche PERSON
would O
at O
once O
raise O
an O
outcry, O
and O
have O
him O
put O
from O
the O
door; O
wherefore, O
he O
was O
the O
more O
enraptured O
at O
the O
turn O
that O
things O
had O
taken, O
and O
spent O
the O
month O
in O
a O
state O
of O
senseless O
ecstasy. O
Already O
I O
had O
learnt O
that, O
after O
our O
unexpected O
departure O
from O
Roulettenberg, O
he O
had O
had O
a O
sort O
of O
a O
fit--that O
he O
had O
fallen O
into O
a O
swoon, O
and O
spent O
a O
week O
in O
a O
species O
of O
garrulous O
delirium. O
Doctors O
had O
been O
summoned O
to O
him, O
but O
he O
had O
broken O
away O
from O
them, O
and O
suddenly O
taken O
a O
train O
to O
Paris. O
Of O
course O
Blanche's O
reception O
of O
him O
had O
acted O
as O
the O
best O
of O
all O
possible O
cures, O
but O
for O
long O
enough O
he O
carried O
the O
marks O
of O
his O
affliction, O
despite O
his O
present O
condition O
of O
rapture O
and O
delight. O
To O
think O
clearly, O
or O
even O
to O
engage O
in O
any O
serious O
conversation, O
had O
now O
become O
impossible O
for O
him; O
he O
could O
only O
ejaculate O
after O
each O
word O
"Hm!" O
and O
then O
nod O
his O
head O
in O
confirmation. O
Sometimes, O
also, O
he O
would O
laugh, O
but O
only O
in O
a O
nervous, O
hysterical O
sort O
of O
a O
fashion; O
while O
at O
other O
times O
he O
would O
sit O
for O
hours O
looking O
as O
black O
as O
night, O
with O
his O
heavy O
eyebrows O
knitted. O
Of O
much O
that O
went O
on O
he O
remained O
wholly O
oblivious, O
for O
he O
grew O
extremely O
absent-minded, O
and O
took O
to O
talking O
to O
himself. O
Only O
Blanche O
could O
awake O
him O
to O
any O
semblance O
of O
life. O
His O
fits O
of O
depression O
and O
moodiness O
in O
corners O
always O
meant O
either O
that O
he O
had O
not O
seen O
her O
for O
some O
while, O
or O
that O
she O
had O
gone O
out O
without O
taking O
him O
with O
her, O
or O
that O
she O
had O
omitted O
to O
caress O
him O
before O
departing. O
When O
in O
this O
condition, O
he O
would O
refuse O
to O
say O
what O
he O
wanted--nor O
had O
he O
the O
least O
idea O
that O
he O
was O
thus O
sulking O
and O
moping. O
Next, O
after O
remaining O
in O
this O
condition O
for O
an O
hour O
or O
two O
(this O
I O
remarked O
on O
two O
occasions O
when O
Blanche PERSON
had O
gone O
out O
for O
the O
day--probably O
to O
see O
Albert), O
he O
would O
begin O
to O
look O
about O
him, O
and O
to O
grow O
uneasy, O
and O
to O
hurry O
about O
with O
an O
air O
as O
though O
he O
had O
suddenly O
remembered O
something, O
and O
must O
try O
and O
find O
it; O
after O
which, O
not O
perceiving O
the O
object O
of O
his O
search, O
nor O
succeeding O
in O
recalling O
what O
that O
object O
had O
been, O
he O
would O
as O
suddenly O
relapse O
into O
oblivion, O
and O
continue O
so O
until O
the O
reappearance O
of O
Blanche--merry, O
wanton, O
half-dressed, O
and O
laughing O
her O
strident O
laugh O
as O
she O
approached O
to O
pet O
him, O
and O
even O
to O
kiss O
him O
(though O
the O
latter O
reward O
he O
seldom O
received). O
Once, O
he O
was O
so O
overjoyed O
at O
her O
doing O
so O
that O
he O
burst O
into O
tears. O
Even O
I O
myself O
was O
surprised. O
From O
the O
first O
moment O
of O
his O
arrival O
in O
Paris, O
Blanche PERSON
set O
herself O
to O
plead O
with O
me O
on O
his O
behalf; O
and O
at O
such O
times O
she O
even O
rose O
to O
heights O
of O
eloquence--saying O
that O
it O
was O
for O
ME O
she O
had O
abandoned O
him, O
though O
she O
had O
almost O
become O
his O
betrothed O
and O
promised O
to O
become O
so; O
that O
it O
was O
for O
HER O
sake O
he O
had O
deserted O
his O
family; O
that, O
having O
been O
in O
his O
service, O
I O
ought O
to O
remember O
the O
fact, O
and O
to O
feel O
ashamed. O
To O
all O
this O
I O
would O
say O
nothing, O
however O
much O
she O
chattered O
on; O
until O
at O
length O
I O
would O
burst O
out O
laughing, O
and O
the O
incident O
would O
come O
to O
an O
end O
(at O
first, O
as O
I O
have O
said, O
she O
had O
thought O
me O
a O
fool, O
but O
since O
she O
had O
come O
to O
deem O
me O
a O
man O
of O
sense O
and O
sensibility). O
In O
short, O
I O
had O
the O
happiness O
of O
calling O
her O
better O
nature O
into O
play; O
for O
though, O
at O
first, O
I O
had O
not O
deemed O
her O
so, O
she O
was, O
in O
reality, O
a O
kind-hearted O
woman O
after O
her O
own O
fashion. O
"You O
are O
good O
and O
clever," O
she O
said O
to O
me O
towards O
the O
finish, O
"and O
my O
one O
regret O
is O
that O
you O
are O
also O
so O
wrong-headed. O
You O
will O
NEVER O
be O
a O
rich O
man!" O
"Un O
vrai O
Russe--un O
Kalmuk" O
she O
usually O
called O
me. O
Several O
times O
she O
sent O
me O
to O
give O
the O
General O
an O
airing O
in O
the O
streets, O
even O
as O
she O
might O
have O
done O
with O
a O
lacquey O
and O
her O
spaniel; O
but, O
I O
preferred O
to O
take O
him O
to O
the O
theatre, O
to O
the O
Bal O
Mabille, O
and O
to O
restaurants. O
For O
this O
purpose O
she O
usually O
allowed O
me O
some O
money, O
though O
the O
General O
had O
a O
little O
of O
his O
own, O
and O
enjoyed O
taking O
out O
his O
purse O
before O
strangers. O
Once O
I O
had O
to O
use O
actual O
force O
to O
prevent O
him O
from O
buying O
a O
phaeton O
at O
a O
price O
of O
seven O
hundred O
francs, O
after O
a O
vehicle O
had O
caught O
his O
fancy O
in O
the O
Palais LOCATION
Royal LOCATION
as O
seeming O
to O
be O
a O
desirable O
present O
for O
Blanche. O
What O
could O
SHE O
have O
done O
with O
a O
seven-hundred-franc O
phaeton?--and O
the O
General O
possessed O
in O
the O
world O
but O
a O
thousand O
francs! O
The O
origin O
even O
of O
those O
francs O
I O
could O
never O
determine, O
but O
imagined O
them O
to O
have O
emanated O
from O
Mr. O
Astley--the O
more O
so O
since O
the O
latter O
had O
paid O
the O
family's O
hotel O
bill. O
As O
for O
what O
view O
the O
General O
took O
of O
myself, O
I O
think O
that O
he O
never O
divined O
the O
footing O
on O
which O
I O
stood O
with O
Blanche. O
True, O
he O
had O
heard, O
in O
a O
dim O
sort O
of O
way, O
that O
I O
had O
won O
a O
good O
deal O
of O
money; O
but O
more O
probably O
he O
supposed O
me O
to O
be O
acting O
as O
secretary--or O
even O
as O
a O
kind O
of O
servant--to O
his O
inamorata. O
At O
all O
events, O
he O
continued O
to O
address O
me, O
in O
his O
old O
haughty O
style, O
as O
my O
superior. O
At O
times O
he O
even O
took O
it O
upon O
himself O
to O
scold O
me. O
One O
morning O
in O
particular, O
he O
started O
to O
sneer O
at O
me O
over O
our O
matutinal O
coffee. O
Though O
not O
a O
man O
prone O
to O
take O
offence, O
he O
suddenly, O
and O
for O
some O
reason O
of O
which O
to O
this O
day O
I O
am O
ignorant, O
fell O
out O
with O
me. O
Of O
course O
even O
he O
himself O
did O
not O
know O
the O
reason. O
To O
put O
things O
shortly, O
he O
began O
a O
speech O
which O
had O
neither O
beginning O
nor O
ending, O
and O
cried O
out, O
a O
batons O
rompus, O
that O
I O
was O
a O
boy O
whom O
he O
would O
soon O
put O
to O
rights--and O
so O
forth, O
and O
so O
forth. O
Yet O
no O
one O
could O
understand O
what O
he O
was O
saying, O
and O
at O
length O
Blanche PERSON
exploded O
in O
a O
burst O
of O
laughter. O
Finally O
something O
appeased O
him, O
and O
he O
was O
taken O
out O
for O
his O
walk. O
More O
than O
once, O
however, O
I O
noticed O
that O
his O
depression O
was O
growing O
upon O
him; O
that O
he O
seemed O
to O
be O
feeling O
the O
want O
of O
somebody O
or O
something; O
that, O
despite O
Blanche's O
presence, O
he O
was O
missing O
some O
person O
in O
particular. O
Twice, O
on O
these O
occasions, O
did O
he O
plunge O
into O
a O
conversation O
with O
me, O
though O
he O
could O
not O
make O
himself O
intelligible, O
and O
only O
went O
on O
rambling O
about O
the O
service, O
his O
late O
wife, O
his O
home, O
and O
his O
property. O
Every O
now O
and O
then, O
also, O
some O
particular O
word O
would O
please O
him; O
whereupon O
he O
would O
repeat O
it O
a O
hundred O
times O
in O
the O
day--even O
though O
the O
word O
happened O
to O
express O
neither O
his O
thoughts O
nor O
his O
feelings. O
Again, O
I O
would O
try O
to O
get O
him O
to O
talk O
about O
his O
children, O
but O
always O
he O
cut O
me O
short O
in O
his O
old O
snappish O
way, O
and O
passed O
to O
another O
subject. O
"Yes, O
yes--my O
children," O
was O
all O
that O
I O
could O
extract O
from O
him. O
"Yes, O
you O
are O
right O
in O
what O
you O
have O
said O
about O
them." O
Only O
once O
did O
he O
disclose O
his O
real O
feelings. O
That O
was O
when O
we O
were O
taking O
him O
to O
the O
theatre, O
and O
suddenly O
he O
exclaimed: O
"My O
unfortunate O
children! O
Yes, O
sir, O
they O
are O
unfortunate O
children." O
Once, O
too, O
when O
I O
chanced O
to O
mention O
Polina, O
he O
grew O
quite O
bitter O
against O
her. O
"She O
is O
an O
ungrateful O
woman!" O
he O
exclaimed. O
"She O
is O
a O
bad O
and O
ungrateful O
woman! O
She O
has O
broken O
up O
a O
family. O
If O
there O
were O
laws O
here, O
I O
would O
have O
her O
impaled. O
Yes, O
I O
would." O
As O
for O
De O
Griers, O
the O
General O
would O
not O
have O
his O
name O
mentioned. O
"He O
has O
ruined O
me," O
he O
would O
say. O
"He O
has O
robbed O
me, O
and O
cut O
my O
throat. O
For O
two O
years O
he O
was O
a O
perfect O
nightmare O
to O
me. O
For O
months O
at O
a O
time O
he O
never O
left O
me O
in O
my O
dreams. O
Do O
not O
speak O
of O
him O
again." O
It O
was O
now O
clear O
to O
me O
that O
Blanche PERSON
and O
he O
were O
on O
the O
point O
of O
coming O
to O
terms; O
yet, O
true O
to O
my O
usual O
custom, O
I O
said O
nothing. O
At O
length, O
Blanche PERSON
took O
the O
initiative O
in O
explaining O
matters. O
She O
did O
so O
a O
week O
before O
we O
parted. O
"Il O
a O
du O
chance," O
she O
prattled, O
"for O
the O
Grandmother O
is O
now O
REALLY O
ill, O
and O
therefore, O
bound O
to O
die. O
Mr. O
Astley PERSON
has O
just O
sent O
a O
telegram O
to O
say O
so, O
and O
you O
will O
agree O
with O
me O
that O
the O
General O
is O
likely O
to O
be O
her O
heir. O
Even O
if O
he O
should O
not O
be O
so, O
he O
will O
not O
come O
amiss, O
since, O
in O
the O
first O
place, O
he O
has O
his O
pension, O
and, O
in O
the O
second O
place, O
he O
will O
be O
content O
to O
live O
in O
a O
back O
room; O
whereas O
I O
shall O
be O
Madame O
General, O
and O
get O
into O
a O
good O
circle O
of O
society" O
(she O
was O
always O
thinking O
of O
this) O
"and O
become O
a O
Russian O
chatelaine. O
Yes, O
I O
shall O
have O
a O
mansion O
of O
my O
own, O
and O
peasants, O
and O
a O
million O
of O
money O
at O
my O
back." O
"But, O
suppose O
he O
should O
prove O
jealous? O
He O
might O
demand O
all O
sorts O
of O
things, O
you O
know. O
Do O
you O
follow O
me?" O
"Oh, O
dear O
no! O
How O
ridiculous O
that O
would O
be O
of O
him! O
Besides, O
I O
have O
taken O
measures O
to O
prevent O
it. O
You O
need O
not O
be O
alarmed. O
That O
is O
to O
say, O
I O
have O
induced O
him O
to O
sign O
notes O
of O
hand O
in O
Albert's O
name. O
Consequently, O
at O
any O
time O
I O
could O
get O
him O
punished. O
Isn't O
he O
ridiculous?" O
"Very O
well, O
then. O
Marry O
him." O
And, O
in O
truth, O
she O
did O
so--though O
the O
marriage O
was O
a O
family O
one O
only, O
and O
involved O
no O
pomp O
or O
ceremony. O
In O
fact, O
she O
invited O
to O
the O
nuptials O
none O
but O
Albert PERSON
and O
a O
few O
other O
friends. O
Hortense, O
Cleopatre, O
and O
the O
rest O
she O
kept O
firmly O
at O
a O
distance. O
As O
for O
the O
bridegroom, O
he O
took O
a O
great O
interest O
in O
his O
new O
position. O
Blanche O
herself O
tied O
his O
tie, O
and O
Blanche PERSON
herself O
pomaded O
him--with O
the O
result O
that, O
in O
his O
frockcoat O
and O
white O
waistcoat, O
he O
looked O
quite O
comme O
il O
faut. O
"Il O
est, O
pourtant, O
TRES O
comme O
il O
faut," O
Blanche PERSON
remarked O
when O
she O
issued O
from O
his O
room, O
as O
though O
the O
idea O
that O
he O
was O
"TRES O
comme O
il O
faut" O
had O
impressed O
even O
her. O
For O
myself, O
I O
had O
so O
little O
knowledge O
of O
the O
minor O
details O
of O
the O
affair, O
and O
took O
part O
in O
it O
so O
much O
as O
a O
supine O
spectator, O
that O
I O
have O
forgotten O
most O
of O
what O
passed O
on O
this O
occasion. O
I O
only O
remember O
that O
Blanche PERSON
and O
the O
Widow O
figured O
at O
it, O
not O
as O
"de O
Cominges," O
but O
as O
"du O
Placet." O
Why O
they O
had O
hitherto O
been O
"de O
Cominges" O
I O
do O
not O
know--I O
only O
know O
that O
this O
entirely O
satisfied O
the O
General, O
that O
he O
liked O
the O
name O
"du O
Placet" O
even O
better O
than O
he O
had O
liked O
the O
name O
"de O
Cominges." O
On O
the O
morning O
of O
the O
wedding, O
he O
paced O
the O
salon O
in O
his O
gala O
attire O
and O
kept O
repeating O
to O
himself O
with O
an O
air O
of O
great O
gravity O
and O
importance: O
"Mlle. O
Blanche O
du O
Placet! O
Mlle. O
Blanche O
du O
Placet, O
du O
Placet!" O
He O
beamed O
with O
satisfaction O
as O
he O
did O
so. O
Both O
in O
the O
church O
and O
at O
the O
wedding O
breakfast O
he O
remained O
not O
only O
pleased O
and O
contented, O
but O
even O
proud. O
She O
too O
underwent O
a O
change, O
for O
now O
she O
assumed O
an O
air O
of O
added O
dignity. O
"I O
must O
behave O
altogether O
differently," O
she O
confided O
to O
me O
with O
a O
serious O
air. O
"Yet, O
mark O
you, O
there O
is O
a O
tiresome O
circumstance O
of O
which O
I O
had O
never O
before O

is, O
how O
best O
to O
pronounce O
my O
new O
family O
name. O

Consonants--oh O
these O
infernal O
Russian O
names! O
The O
LAST O
of O
them O
would O
be O
the O
best O
to O
use, O
don't O
you O
think?" O
At O
length O
the O
time O
had O
come O
for O
us O
to O
part, O
and O
Blanche, O
the O
egregious O
Blanche, O
shed O
real O
tears O
as O
she O
took O
her O
leave O
of O
me. O
"Tu O
etais O
bon O
enfant" O
she O
said O
with O
a O
sob. O
"Je O
te O
croyais O
bete O
et O
tu O
en O
avais O
l'air, O
but O
it O
suited O
you." O
Then, O
having O
given O
me O
a O
final O
handshake, O
she O
exclaimed, O
"Attends!"; O
whereafter, O
running O
into O
her O
boudoir, O
she O
brought O
me O
thence O
two O
thousand-franc O
notes. O
I O
could O
scarcely O
believe O
my O
eyes! O
"They O
may O
come O
in O
handy O
for O
you," O
she O
explained, O
"for, O
though O
you O
are O
a O
very O
learned O
tutor, O
you O
are O
a O
very O
stupid O
man. O
More O
than O
two O
thousand O
francs, O
however, O
I O
am O
not O
going O
to O
give O
you, O
for O
the O
reason O
that, O
if O
I O
did O
so, O
you O
would O
gamble O
them O
all O
away. O
Now O
good-bye. O
Nous O
serons O
toujours O
bons O
amis, O
and O
if O
you O
win O
again, O
do O
not O
fail O
to O
come O
to O
me, O
et O
tu O
seras O
heureux." O
I O
myself O
had O
still O
five O
hundred O
francs O
left, O
as O
well O
as O
a O
watch O
worth O
a O
thousand O
francs, O
a O
few O
diamond O
studs, O
and O
so O
on. O
Consequently, O
I O
could O
subsist O
for O
quite O
a O
length O
of O
time O
without O
particularly O
bestirring O
myself. O
Purposely O
I O
have O
taken O
up O
my O
abode O
where O
I O
am O
now O
partly O
to O
pull O
myself O
together, O
and O
partly O
to O
wait O
for O
Mr. O
Astley, O
who, O
I O
have O
learnt, O
will O
soon O
be O
here O
for O
a O
day O
or O
so O
on O
business. O
Yes, O
I O
know O
that, O
and O
then--and O
then O
I O
shall O
go O
to O
Homburg. O
But O
to O
Roulettenberg O
I O
shall O
not O
go O
until O
next O
year, O
for O
they O
say O
it O
is O
bad O
to O
try O
one's O
luck O
twice O
in O
succession O
at O
a O
table. O
Moreover, O
Homburg O
is O
where O
the O
best O
play O
is O
carried O
on. O
XVII O
It O
is O
a O
year O
and O
eight O
months O
since O
I O
last O
looked O
at O
these O
notes O
of O
mine. O
I O
do O
so O
now O
only O
because, O
being O
overwhelmed O
with O
depression, O
I O
wish O
to O
distract O
my O
mind O
by O
reading O
them O
through O
at O
random. O
I O
left O
them O
off O
at O
the O
point O
where O
I O
was O
just O
going O
to O
Homburg. O
My O
God, O
with O
what O
a O
light O
heart O
(comparatively O
speaking) O
did O
I O
write O
the O
concluding O
lines!--though O
it O
may O
be O
not O
so O
much O
with O
a O
light O
heart, O
as O
with O
a O
measure O
of O
self-confidence O
and O
unquenchable O
hope. O
At O
that O
time O
had O
I O
any O
doubts O
of O
myself? O
Yet O
behold O
me O
now. O
Scarcely O
a O
year O
and O
a O
half O
have O
passed, O
yet O
I O
am O
in O
a O
worse O
position O
than O
the O
meanest O
beggar. O
But O
what O
is O
a O
beggar? O
A O
fig O
for O
beggary! O
I O
have O
ruined O
myself--that O
is O
all. O
Nor O
is O
there O
anything O
with O
which O
I O
can O
compare O
myself; O
there O
is O
no O
moral O
which O
it O
would O
be O
of O
any O
use O
for O
you O
to O
read O
to O
me. O
At O
the O
present O
moment O
nothing O
could O
well O
be O
more O
incongruous O
than O
a O
moral. O
Oh, O
you O
self-satisfied O
persons O
who, O
in O
your O
unctuous O
pride, O
are O
forever O
ready O
to O
mouth O
your O
maxims--if O
only O
you O
knew O
how O
fully O
I O
myself O
comprehend O
the O
sordidness O
of O
my O
present O
state, O
you O
would O
not O
trouble O
to O
wag O
your O
tongues O
at O
me! O
What O
could O
you O
say O
to O
me O
that O
I O
do O
not O
already O
know? O
Well, O
wherein O
lies O
my O
difficulty? O
It O
lies O
in O
the O
fact O
that O
by O
a O
single O
turn O
of O
a O
roulette O
wheel O
everything O
for O
me, O
has O
become O
changed. O
Yet, O
had O
things O
befallen O
otherwise, O
these O
moralists O
would O
have O
been O
among O
the O
first O
(yes, O
I O
feel O
persuaded O
of O
it) O
to O
approach O
me O
with O
friendly O
jests O
and O
congratulations. O
Yes, O
they O
would O
never O
have O
turned O
from O
me O
as O
they O
are O
doing O
now! O
A O
fig O
for O
all O
of O
them! O
What O
am O
I? O
I O
am O
zero--nothing. O
What O
shall O
I O
be O
tomorrow? O
I O
may O
be O
risen O
from O
the O
dead, O
and O
have O
begun O
life O
anew. O
For O
still, O
I O
may O
discover O
the O
man O
in O
myself, O
if O
only O
my O
manhood O
has O
not O
become O
utterly O
shattered. O
I O
went, O
I O
say, O
to O
Homburg, O
but O
afterwards O
went O
also O
to O
Roulettenberg, O
as O
well O
as O
to O
Spa O
and O
Baden; O
in O
which O
latter O
place, O
for O
a O
time, O
I O
acted O
as O
valet O
to O
a O
certain O
rascal O
of O
a O
Privy O
Councillor, O
by O
name O
Heintze, O
who O
until O
lately O
was O
also O
my O
master O
here. O
Yes, O
for O
five O
months O
I O
lived O
my O
life O
with O
lacqueys! O
That O
was O
just O
after O
I O
had O
come O
out O
of O
Roulettenberg LOCATION
prison, O
where O
I O
had O
lain O
for O
a O
small O
debt O
which O
I O
owed. O
Out O
of O
that O
prison O
I O
was O
bailed O
by--by O
whom? O
By O
Mr. O
Astley? O
By O
Polina? O
I O
do O
not O
know. O
At O
all O
events, O
the O
debt O
was O
paid O
to O
the O
tune O
of O
two O
hundred O
thalers, O
and O
I O
sallied O
forth O
a O
free O
man. O
But O
what O
was O
I O
to O
do O
with O
myself? O
In O
my O
dilemma O
I O
had O
recourse O
to O
this O
Heintze, O
who O
was O
a O
young O
scapegrace, O
and O
the O
sort O
of O
man O
who O
could O
speak O
and O
write O
three O
languages. O
At O
first O
I O
acted O
as O
his O
secretary, O
at O
a O
salary O
of O
thirty O
gulden O
a O
month, O
but O
afterwards O
I O
became O
his O
lacquey, O
for O
the O
reason O
that O
he O
could O
not O
afford O
to O
keep O
a O
secretary--only O
an O
unpaid O
servant. O
I O
had O
nothing O
else O
to O
turn O
to, O
so O
I O
remained O
with O
him, O
and O
allowed O
myself O
to O
become O
his O
flunkey. O
But O
by O
stinting O
myself O
in O
meat O
and O
drink O
I O
saved, O
during O
my O
five O
months O
of O
service, O
some O
seventy O
gulden; O
and O
one O
evening, O
when O
we O
were O
at O
Baden, O
I O
told O
him O
that O
I O
wished O
to O
resign O
my O
post, O
and O
then O
hastened O
to O
betake O
myself O
to O
roulette. O
Oh, O
how O
my O
heart O
beat O
as O
I O
did O
so! O
No, O
it O
was O
not O
the O
money O
that O
I O
valued--what O
I O
wanted O
was O
to O
make O
all O
this O
mob O
of O
Heintzes, O
hotel O
proprietors, O
and O
fine O
ladies O
of O
Baden PERSON
talk O
about O
me, O
recount O
my O
story, O
wonder O
at O
me, O
extol O
my O
doings, O
and O
worship O
my O
winnings. O
True, O
these O
were O
childish O
fancies O
and O
aspirations, O
but O
who O
knows O
but O
that O
I O
might O
meet O
Polina, O
and O
be O
able O
to O
tell O
her O
everything, O
and O
see O
her O
look O
of O
surprise O
at O
the O
fact O
that O
I O
had O
overcome O
so O
many O
adverse O
strokes O
of O
fortune. O
No, O
I O
had O
no O
desire O
for O
money O
for O
its O
own O
sake, O
for O
I O
was O
perfectly O
well O
aware O
that O
I O
should O
only O
squander O
it O
upon O
some O
new O
Blanche, O
and O
spend O
another O
three O
weeks O
in O
Paris LOCATION
after O
buying O
a O
pair O
of O
horses O
which O
had O
cost O
sixteen O
thousand O
francs. O
No, O
I O
never O
believed O
myself O
to O
be O
a O
hoarder; O
in O
fact, O
I O
knew O
only O
too O
well O
that O
I O
was O
a O
spendthrift. O
And O
already, O
with O
a O
sort O
of O
fear, O
a O
sort O
of O
sinking O
in O
my O
heart, O
I O
could O
hear O
the O
cries O
of O
the O
croupiers--"Trente O
et O
un, O
rouge, O
impair O
et O
passe," O
"Quarte, O
noir, O
pair O
et O
manque." O
How O
greedily O
I O
gazed O
upon O
the O
gaming-table, O
with O
its O
scattered O
louis O
d'or, O
ten-gulden O
pieces, O
and O
thalers; O
upon O
the O
streams O
of O
gold O
as O
they O
issued O
from O
the O
croupier's O
hands, O
and O
piled O
themselves O
up O
into O
heaps O
of O
gold O
scintillating O
as O
fire; O
upon O
the O
ell--long O
rolls O
of O
silver O
lying O
around O
the O
croupier. O
Even O
at O
a O
distance O
of O
two O
rooms O
I O
could O
hear O
the O
chink O
of O
that O
money--so O
much O
so O
that O
I O
nearly O
fell O
into O
convulsions. O
Ah, O
the O
evening O
when O
I O
took O
those O
seventy O
gulden O
to O
the O
gaming O
table O
was O
a O
memorable O
one O
for O
me. O
I O
began O
by O
staking O
ten O
gulden O
upon O
passe. O
For O
passe O
I O
had O
always O
had O
a O
sort O
of O
predilection, O
yet O
I O
lost O
my O
stake O
upon O
it. O
This O
left O
me O
with O
sixty O
gulden O
in O
silver. O
After O
a O
moment's O
thought O
I O
selected O
zero--beginning O
by O
staking O
five O
gulden O
at O
a O
time. O
Twice O
I O
lost, O
but O
the O
third O
round O
suddenly O
brought O
up O
the O
desired O
coup. O
I O
could O
almost O
have O
died O
with O
joy O
as O
I O
received O
my O
one O
hundred O
and O
seventy-five O
gulden. O
Indeed, O
I O
have O
been O
less O
pleased O
when, O
in O
former O
times, O
I O
have O
won O
a O
hundred O
thousand O
gulden. O
Losing O
no O
time, O
I O
staked O
another O
hundred O
gulden O
upon O
the O
red, O
and O
won; O
two O
hundred O
upon O
the O
red, O
and O
won; O
four O
hundred O
upon O
the O
black, O
and O
won; O
eight O
hundred O
upon O
manque, O
and O
won. O
Thus, O
with O
the O
addition O
of O
the O
remainder O
of O
my O
original O
capital, O
I O
found O
myself O
possessed, O
within O
five O
minutes, O
of O
seventeen O
hundred O
gulden. O
Ah, O
at O
such O
moments O
one O
forgets O
both O
oneself O
and O
one's O
former O
failures! O
This O
I O
had O
gained O
by O
risking O
my O
very O
life. O
I O
had O
dared O
so O
to O
risk, O
and O
behold, O
again O
I O
was O
a O
member O
of O
mankind! O
I O
went O
and O
hired O
a O
room, O
I O
shut O
myself O
up O
in O
it, O
and O
sat O
counting O
my O
money O
until O
three O
o'clock O
in O
the O
morning. O
To O
think O
that O
when O
I O
awoke O
on O
the O
morrow, O
I O
was O
no O
lacquey! O
I O
decided O
to O
leave O
at O
once O
for O
Homburg. O
There O
I O
should O
neither O
have O
to O
serve O
as O
a O
footman O
nor O
to O
lie O
in O
prison. O
Half O
an O
hour O
before O
starting, O
I O
went O
and O
ventured O
a O
couple O
of O
stakes--no O
more; O
with O
the O
result O
that, O
in O
all, O
I O
lost O
fifteen O
hundred O
florins. O
Nevertheless, O
I O
proceeded O
to O
Homburg, O
and O
have O
now O
been O
there O
for O
a O
month. O
Of O
course, O
I O
am O
living O
in O
constant O
trepidation, O
playing O
for O
the O
smallest O
of O
stakes, O
and O
always O
looking O
out O
for O
something--calculating, O
standing O
whole O
days O
by O
the O
gaming-tables O
to O
watch O
the O
play--even O
seeing O
that O
play O
in O
my O
dreams--yet O
seeming, O
the O
while, O
to O
be O
in O
some O
way O
stiffening, O
to O
be O
growing O
caked, O
as O
it O
were, O
in O
mire. O
But O
I O
must O
conclude O
my O
notes, O
which O
I O
finish O
under O
the O
impression O
of O
a O
recent O
encounter O
with O
Mr. O
Astley. O
I O
had O
not O
seen O
him O
since O
we O
parted O
at O
Roulettenberg, O
and O
now O
we O
met O
quite O
by O
accident. O
At O
the O
time O
I O
was O
walking O
in O
the O
public O
gardens, O
and O
meditating O
upon O
the O
fact O
that O
not O
only O
had O
I O
still O
some O
fifty O
gulden O
in O
my O
possession, O
but O
also O
I O
had O
fully O
paid O
up O
my O
hotel O
bill O
three O
days O
ago. O
Consequently, O
I O
was O
in O
a O
position O
to O
try O
my O
luck O
again O
at O
roulette; O
and O
if O
I O
won O
anything O
I O
should O
be O
able O
to O
continue O
my O
play, O
whereas, O
if O
I O
lost O
what O
I O
now O
possessed, O
I O
should O
once O
more O
have O
to O
accept O
a O
lacquey's O
place, O
provided O
that, O
in O
the O
alternative, O
I O
failed O
to O
discover O
a O
Russian O
family O
which O
stood O
in O
need O
of O
a O
tutor. O
Plunged O
in O
these O
reflections, O
I O
started O
on O
my O
daily O
walk O
through O
the O
Park O
and O
forest O
towards O
a O
neighbouring O
principality. O
Sometimes, O
on O
such O
occasions, O
I O
spent O
four O
hours O
on O
the O
way, O
and O
would O
return O
to O
Homburg O
tired O
and O
hungry; O
but, O
on O
this O
particular O
occasion, O
I O
had O
scarcely O
left O
the O
gardens O
for O
the O
Park O
when O
I O
caught O
sight O
of O
Astley PERSON
seated O
on O
a O
bench. O
As O
soon O
as O
he O
perceived O
me, O
he O
called O
me O
by O
name, O
and O
I O
went O
and O
sat O
down O
beside O
him; O
but, O
on O
noticing O
that O
he O
seemed O
a O
little O
stiff O
in O
his O
manner, O
I O
hastened O
to O
moderate O
the O
expression O
of O
joy O
which O
the O
sight O
of O
him O
had O
called O
forth. O
"YOU O
here?" O
he O
said. O
"Well, O
I O
had O
an O
idea O
that O
I O
should O
meet O
you. O
Do O
not O
trouble O
to O
tell O
me O
anything, O
for O
I O
know O
all--yes, O
all. O
In O
fact, O
your O
whole O
life O
during O
the O
past O
twenty O
months O
lies O
within O
my O
knowledge." O
"How O
closely O
you O
watch O
the O
doings O
of O
your O
old O
friends!" O
I O
replied. O
"That O
does O
you O
infinite O
credit. O
But O
stop O
a O
moment. O
You O
have O
reminded O
me O
of O
something. O
Was O
it O
you O
who O
bailed O
me O
out O
of O
Roulettenberg LOCATION
prison O
when O
I O
was O
lying O
there O
for O
a O
debt O
of O
two O
hundred O
gulden? O
SOMEONE O
did O
so." O
"Oh O
dear O
no!--though O
I O
knew O
all O
the O
time O
that O
you O
were O
lying O
there." O
"Perhaps O
you O
could O
tell O
me O
who O
DID O
bail O
me O
out?" O
"No; O
I O
am O
afraid O
I O
could O
not." O
"What O
a O
strange O
thing! O
For O
I O
know O
no O
Russians O
at O
all O
here, O
so O
it O
cannot O
have O
been O
a O
Russian O
who O
befriended O
me. O
In O

we O
Orthodox O
folk O
DO O
go O
bail O
for O
one O
another, O
but O
in O
this O
case O
I O
thought O
it O
must O
have O
been O
done O
by O
some O
English O
stranger O
who O
was O
not O
conversant O
with O
the O
ways O
of O
the O
country." O
Mr. O
Astley PERSON
seemed O
to O
listen O
to O
me O
with O
a O
sort O
of O
surprise. O
Evidently O
he O
had O
expected O
to O
see O
me O
looking O
more O
crushed O
and O
broken O
than O
I O
was. O
"Well," O
he O
said--not O
very O
pleasantly, O
"I O
am O
none O
the O
less O
glad O
to O
find O
that O
you O
retain O
your O
old O
independence O
of O
spirit, O
as O
well O
as O
your O
buoyancy." O
"Which O
means O
that O
you O
are O
vexed O
at O
not O
having O
found O
me O
more O
abased O
and O
humiliated O
than O
I O
am?" O
I O
retorted O
with O
a O
smile. O
Astley PERSON
was O
not O
quick O
to O
understand O
this, O
but O
presently O
did O
so O
and O
laughed. O
"Your O
remarks O
please O
me O
as O
they O
always O
did," O
he O
continued. O
"In O
those O
words O
I O
see O
the O
clever, O
triumphant, O
and, O
above O
all O
things, O
cynical O
friend O
of O
former O
days. O
Only O
Russians O
have O
the O
faculty O
of O
combining O
within O
themselves O
so O
many O
opposite O
qualities. O
Yes, O
most O
men O
love O
to O
see O
their O
best O
friend O
in O
abasement; O
for O
generally O
it O
is O
on O
such O
abasement O
that O
friendship O
is O
founded. O
All O
thinking O
persons O
know O
that O
ancient O
truth. O
Yet, O
on O
the O
present O
occasion, O
I O
assure O
you, O
I O
am O
sincerely O
glad O
to O
see O
that O
you O
are O
NOT O
cast O
down. O
Tell O
me, O
are O
you O
never O
going O
to O
give O
up O
gambling?" O
"Damn O
the O
gambling! O
Yes, O
I O
should O
certainly O
have O
given O
it O
up, O
were O
it O
not O
that--" O
"That O
you O
are O
losing? O
I O
thought O
so. O
You O
need O
not O
tell O
me O
any O
more. O
I O
know O
how O
things O
stand, O
for O
you O
have O
said O
that O
last O
in O
despair, O
and O
therefore, O
truthfully. O
Have O
you O
no O
other O
employment O
than O
gambling?" O
"No; O
none O
whatever." O
Astley PERSON
gave O
me O
a O
searching O
glance. O
At O
that O
time O
it O
was O
ages O
since O
I O
had O
last O
looked O
at O
a O
paper O
or O
turned O
the O
pages O
of O
a O
book. O
"You O
are O
growing O
blase," O
he O
said. O
"You O
have O
not O
only O
renounced O
life, O
with O
its O
interests O
and O
social O
ties, O
but O
the O
duties O
of O
a O
citizen O
and O
a O
man; O
you O
have O
not O
only O
renounced O
the O
friends O
whom O
I O
know O
you O
to O
have O
had, O
and O
every O
aim O
in O
life O
but O
that O
of O
winning O
money; O
but O
you O
have O
also O
renounced O
your O
memory. O
Though O
I O
can O
remember O
you O
in O
the O
strong, O
ardent O
period O
of O
your O
life, O
I O
feel O
persuaded O
that O
you O
have O
now O
forgotten O
every O
better O
feeling O
of O
that O
period--that O
your O
present O
dreams O
and O
aspirations O
of O
subsistence O
do O
not O
rise O
above O
pair, O
impair O
rouge, O
noir, O
the O
twelve O
middle O
numbers, O
and O
so O
forth." O
"Enough, O
Mr. O
Astley!" O
I O
cried O
with O
some O
irritation--almost O
in O
anger. O
"Kindly O
do O
not O
recall O
to O
me O
any O
more O
recollections, O
for O
I O
can O
remember O
things O
for O
myself. O
Only O
for O
a O
time O
have O
I O
put O
them O
out O
of O
my O
head. O
Only O
until O
I O
shall O
have O
rehabilitated O
myself, O
am O
I O
keeping O
my O
memory O
dulled. O
When O
that O
hour O
shall O
come, O
you O
will O
see O
me O
arise O
from O
the O
dead." O
"Then O
you O
will O
have O
to O
be O
here O
another O
ten O
years," O
he O
replied. O
"Should O
I O
then O
be O
alive, O
I O
will O
remind O
you--here, O
on O
this O
very O
bench--of O
what O
I O
have O
just O
said. O
In O
fact, O
I O
will O
bet O
you O
a O
wager O
that O
I O
shall O
do O
so." O
"Say O
no O
more," O
I O
interrupted O
impatiently. O
"And O
to O
show O
you O
that O
I O
have O
not O
wholly O
forgotten O
the O
past, O
may O
I O
enquire O
where O
Mlle. O
Polina PERSON
is? O
If O
it O
was O
not O
you O
who O
bailed O
me O
out O
of O
prison, O
it O
must O
have O
been O
she. O
Yet O
never O
have O
I O
heard O
a O
word O
concerning O
her." O
"No, O
I O
do O
not O
think O
it O
was O
she. O
At O
the O
present O
moment O
she O
is O
in O
Switzerland, O
and O
you O
will O
do O
me O
a O
favour O
by O
ceasing O
to O
ask O
me O
these O
questions O
about O
her." O
Astley PERSON
said O
this O
with O
a O
firm, O
and O
even O
an O
angry, O
air. O
"Which O
means O
that O
she O
has O
dealt O
you O
a O
serious O
wound?" O
I O
burst O
out O
with O
an O
involuntary O
sneer. O
"Mlle. O
Polina," O
he O
continued, O
"Is O
the O
best O
of O
all O
possible O
living O
beings; O
but, O
I O
repeat, O
that O
I O
shall O
thank O
you O
to O
cease O
questioning O
me O
about O
her. O
You O
never O
really O
knew O
her, O
and O
her O
name O
on O
your O
lips O
is O
an O
offence O
to O
my O
moral O
feeling." O
"Indeed? O
On O
what O
subject, O
then, O
have O
I O
a O
better O
right O
to O
speak O
to O
you O
than O
on O
this? O
With O
it O
are O
bound O
up O
all O
your O
recollections O
and O
mine. O
However, O
do O
not O
be O
alarmed: O
I O
have O
no O
wish O
to O
probe O
too O
far O
into O
your O
private, O
your O
secret O
affairs. O
My O
interest O
in O
Mlle. O
Polina PERSON
does O
not O
extend O
beyond O
her O
outward O
circumstances O
and O
surroundings. O
About O
them O
you O
could O
tell O
me O
in O
two O
words." O
"Well, O
on O
condition O
that O
the O
matter O
shall O
end O
there, O
I O
will O
tell O
you O
that O
for O
a O
long O
time O
Mlle. O
Polina PERSON
was O
ill, O
and O
still O
is O
so. O
My O
mother O
and O
sister O
entertained O
her O
for O
a O
while O
at O
their O
home O
in O
the O
north O
of O
England, O
and O
thereafter O
Mlle. O
Polina's O
grandmother O
(you O
remember O
the O
mad O
old O
woman?) O
died, O
and O
left O
Mlle. O
Polina PERSON
a O
personal O
legacy O
of O
seven O
thousand O
pounds O
sterling. O
That O
was O
about O
six O
months O
ago, O
and O
now O
Mlle. O
is O
travelling O
with O
my O
sister's O
family--my O
sister O
having O
since O
married. O
Mlle.'s O
little O
brother O
and O
sister O
also O
benefited O
by O
the O
Grandmother's O
will, O
and O
are O
now O
being O
educated O
in O
London. LOCATION
As O
for O
the O
General, O
he O
died O
in O
Paris LOCATION
last O
month, O
of O
a O
stroke. O
Mlle. O
Blanche PERSON
did O
well O
by O
him, O
for O
she O
succeeded O
in O
having O
transferred O
to O
herself O
all O
that O
he O
received O
from O
the O
Grandmother. O
That, O
I O
think, O
concludes O
all O
that O
I O
have O
to O
tell." O
"And O
De O
Griers? O
Is O
he O
too O
travelling O
in O
Switzerland?" O
"No; O
nor O
do O
I O
know O
where O
he O
is. O
Also O
I O
warn O
you O
once O
more O
that O
you O
had O
better O
avoid O
such O
hints O
and O
ignoble O
suppositions; O
otherwise O
you O
will O
assuredly O
have O
to O
reckon O
with O
me." O
"What? O
In O
spite O
of O
our O
old O
friendship?" O
"Yes, O
in O
spite O
of O
our O
old O
friendship." O
"Then O
I O
beg O
your O
pardon O
a O
thousand O
times, O
Mr. O
Astley. O
I O
meant O
nothing O
offensive O
to O
Mlle. O
Polina, O
for O
I O
have O
nothing O
of O
which O
to O
accuse O
her. O
Moreover, O
the O
question O
of O
there O
being O
anything O
between O
this O
Frenchman O
and O
this O
Russian O
lady O
is O
not O
one O
which O
you O
and O
I O
need O
discuss, O
nor O
even O
attempt O
to O
understand." O
"If," O
replied O
Astley, O
"you O
do O
not O
care O
to O
hear O
their O
names O
coupled O
together, O
may O
I O
ask O
you O
what O
you O
mean O
by O
the O
expressions O
'this O
Frenchman,' O
'this O
Russian O
lady,' O
and O
'there O
being O
anything O
between O
them'? O
Why O
do O
you O
call O
them O
so O
particularly O
a O
'Frenchman' O
and O
a O
'Russian O
lady'?" O
"Ah, O
I O
see O
you O
are O
interested, O
Mr. O
Astley. O
But O
it O
is O
a O
long, O
long O
story, O
and O
calls O
for O
a O
lengthy O
preface. O
At O
the O
same O
time, O
the O
question O
is O
an O
important O
one, O
however O
ridiculous O
it O
may O
seem O
at O
the O
first O
glance. O
A O
Frenchman, O
Mr. O
Astley, O
is O
merely O
a O
fine O
figure O
of O
a O
man. O
With O
this O
you, O
as O
a O
Britisher, O
may O
not O
agree. O
With O
it O
I O
also, O
as O
a O
Russian, O
may O
not O
agree--out O
of O
envy. O
Yet O
possibly O
our O
good O
ladies O
are O
of O
another O
opinion. O
For O
instance, O
one O
may O
look O
upon O
Racine LOCATION
as O
a O
broken-down, O
hobbledehoy, O
perfumed O
individual--one O
may O
even O
be O
unable O
to O
read O
him; O
and O
I O
too O
may O
think O
him O
the O
same, O
as O
well O
as, O
in O
some O
respects, O
a O
subject O
for O
ridicule. O
Yet O
about O
him, O
Mr. O
Astley, O
there O
is O
a O
certain O
charm, O
and, O
above O
all O
things, O
he O
is O
a O
great O
poet--though O
one O
might O
like O
to O
deny O
it. O
Yes, O
the O
Frenchman, O
the O
Parisian, O
as O
a O
national O
figure, O
was O
in O
process O
of O
developing O
into O
a O
figure O
of O
elegance O
before O
we O
Russians O
had O
even O
ceased O
to O
be O
bears. O
The O
Revolution O
bequeathed O
to O
the O
French O
nobility O
its O
heritage, O
and O
now O
every O
whippersnapper O
of O
a O
Parisian O
may O
possess O
manners, O
methods O
of O
expression, O
and O
even O
thoughts O
that O
are O
above O
reproach O
in O
form, O
while O
all O
the O
time O
he O
himself O
may O
share O
in O
that O
form O
neither O
in O
initiative O
nor O
in O
intellect O
nor O
in O
soul--his O
manners, O
and O
the O
rest, O
having O
come O
to O
him O
through O
inheritance. O
Yes, O
taken O
by O
himself, O
the O
Frenchman O
is O
frequently O
a O
fool O
of O
fools O
and O
a O
villain O
of O
villains. O
Per O
contra, O
there O
is O
no O
one O
in O
the O
world O
more O
worthy O
of O
confidence O
and O
respect O
than O
this O
young O
Russian O
lady. O
De PERSON
Griers PERSON
might O
so O
mask O
his O
face O
and O
play O
a O
part O
as O
easily O
to O
overcome O
her O
heart, O
for O
he O
has O
an O
imposing O
figure, O
Mr. O
Astley, O
and O
this O
young O
lady O
might O
easily O
take O
that O
figure O
for O
his O
real O
self--for O
the O
natural O
form O
of O
his O
heart O
and O
soul--instead O
of O
the O
mere O
cloak O
with O
which O
heredity O
has O
dowered O
him. O
And O
even O
though O
it O
may O
offend O
you, O
I O
feel O
bound O
to O
say O
that O
the O
majority O
also O
of O
English O
people O
are O
uncouth O
and O
unrefined, O
whereas O
we O
Russian O
folk O
can O
recognise O
beauty O
wherever O
we O
see O
it, O
and O
are O
always O
eager O
to O
cultivate O
the O
same. O
But O
to O
distinguish O
beauty O
of O
soul O
and O
personal O
originality O
there O
is O
needed O
far O
more O
independence O
and O
freedom O
than O
is O
possessed O
by O
our O
women, O
especially O
by O
our O
younger O
ladies. O
At O
all O
events, O
they O
need O
more O
EXPERIENCE. O
For O
instance, O
this O
Mlle. O
Polina--pardon O
me, O
but O
the O
name O
has O
passed O
my O
lips, O
and O
I O
cannot O
well O
recall O
it--is O
taking O
a O
very O
long O
time O
to O
make O
up O
her O
mind O
to O
prefer O
you O
to O
Monsieur O
de O
Griers. O
She O
may O
respect O
you, O
she O
may O
become O
your O
friend, O
she O
may O
open O
out O
her O
heart O
to O
you; O
yet O
over O
that O
heart O
there O
will O
be O
reigning O
that O
loathsome O
villain, O
that O
mean O
and O
petty O
usurer, O
De O
Griers. O
This O
will O
be O
due O
to O
obstinacy O
and O
self-love--to O
the O
fact O
that O
De PERSON
Griers PERSON
once O
appeared O
to O
her O
in O
the O
transfigured O
guise O
of O
a O
marquis, O
of O
a O
disenchanted O
and O
ruined O
liberal O
who O
was O
doing O
his O
best O
to O
help O
her O
family O
and O
the O
frivolous O
old O
General; O
and, O
although O
these O
transactions O
of O
his O
have O
since O
been O
exposed, O
you O
will O
find O
that O
the O
exposure O
has O
made O
no O
impression O
upon O
her O
mind. O
Only O
give O
her O
the O
De PERSON
Griers PERSON
of O
former O
days, O
and O
she O
will O
ask O
of O
you O
no O
more. O
The O
more O
she O
may O
detest O
the O
present O
De O
Griers, O
the O
more O
will O
she O
lament O
the O
De PERSON
Griers PERSON
of O
the O
past--even O
though O
the O
latter O
never O
existed O
but O
in O
her O
own O
imagination. O
You O
are O
a O
sugar O
refiner, O
Mr. O
Astley, O
are O
you O
not?" O
"Yes, O
I O
belong O
to O
the O
well-known O
firm O
of O
Lovell PERSON
and O
Co." O
"Then O
see O
here. O
On O
the O
one O
hand, O
you O
are O
a O
sugar O
refiner, O
while, O
on O
the O
other O
hand, O
you O
are O
an O
Apollo O
Belvedere. O
But O
the O
two O
characters O
do O
not O
mix O
with O
one O
another. O
I, O
again, O
am O
not O
even O
a O
sugar O
refiner; O
I O
am O
a O
mere O
roulette O
gambler O
who O
has O
also O
served O
as O
a O
lacquey. O
Of O
this O
fact O
Mlle. O
Polina PERSON
is O
probably O
well O
aware, O
since O
she O
appears O
to O
have O
an O
excellent O
force O
of O
police O
at O
her O
disposal." O
"You O
are O
saying O
this O
because O
you O
are O
feeling O
bitter," O
said O
Astley PERSON
with O
cold O
indifference. O
"Yet O
there O
is O
not O
the O
least O
originality O
in O
your O
words." O
"I O
agree. O
But O
therein O
lies O
the O
horror O
of O
it O
all--that, O
how O
trepidation, O
playing O
ever O
mean O
and O
farcical O
my O
accusations O
may O
be, O
they O
are O
none O
the O
less O
TRUE. O
But O
I O
am O
only O
wasting O
words." O
"Yes, O
you O
are, O
for O
you O
are O
only O
talking O
nonsense!" O
exclaimed O
my O
companion--his O
voice O
now O
trembling O
and O
his O
eyes O
flashing O
fire. O
"Are O
you O
aware," O
he O
continued, O
"that O
wretched, O
ignoble, O
petty, O
unfortunate O
man O
though O
you O
are, O
it O
was O
at O
HER O
request O
I O
came O
to O
Homburg, O
in O
order O
to O
see O
you, O
and O
to O
have O
a O
long, O
serious O
talk O
with O
you, O
and O
to O
report O
to O
her O
your O
feelings O
and O
thoughts O
and O
hopes--yes, O
and O
your O
recollections O
of O
her, O
too?" O
"Indeed? O
Is O
that O
really O
so?" O
I O
cried--the O
tears O
beginning O
to O
well O
from O
my O
eyes. O
Never O
before O
had O
this O
happened. O
"Yes, O
poor O
unfortunate," O
continued O
Astley. O
"She O
DID O
love O
you; O
and O
I O
may O
tell O
you O
this O
now O
for O
the O
reason O
that O
now O
you O
are O
utterly O
lost. O
Even O
if O
I O
were O
also O
to O
tell O
you O
that O
she O
still O
loves O
you, O
you O
would O
none O
the O
less O
have O
to O
remain O
where O
you O
are. O
Yes, O
you O
have O
ruined O
yourself O
beyond O
redemption. O
Once O
upon O
a O
time O
you O
had O
a O
certain O
amount O
of O
talent, O
and O
you O
were O
of O
a O
lively O
disposition, O
and O
your O
good O
looks O
were O
not O
to O
be O
despised. O
You O
might O
even O
have O
been O
useful O
to O
your O
country, O
which O
needs O
men O
like O
you. O
Yet O
you O
remained O
here, O
and O
your O
life O
is O
now O
over. O
I O
am O
not O
blaming O
you O
for O
this--in O
my O
view O
all O
Russians O
resemble O
you, O
or O
are O
inclined O
to O
do O
so. O
If O
it O
is O
not O
roulette, O
then O
it O
is O
something O
else. O
The O
exceptions O
are O
very O
rare. O
Nor O
are O
you O
the O
first O
to O
learn O
what O
a O
taskmaster O
is O
yours. O
For O
roulette O
is O
not O
exclusively O
a O
Russian O
game. O
Hitherto, O
you O
have O
honourably O
preferred O
to O
serve O
as O
a O
lacquey O
rather O
than O
to O
act O
as O
a O
thief; O
but O
what O
the O
future O
may O
have O
in O
store O
for O
you O
I O
tremble O
to O
think. O
Now O
good-bye. O
You O
are O
in O
want O
of O
money, O
I O
suppose? O
Then O
take O
these O
ten O
louis O
d'or. O
More O
I O
shall O
not O
give O
you, O
for O
you O
would O
only O
gamble O
it O
away. O
Take O
care O
of O
these O
coins, O
and O
farewell. O
Once O
more, O
TAKE O
CARE O
of O
them." O
"No, O
Mr. O
Astley. O
After O
all O
that O
has O
been O
said O
I--" O
"TAKE O
CARE O
of O
them!" O
repeated O
my O
friend. O
"I O
am O
certain O
you O
are O
still O
a O
gentleman, O
and O
therefore O
I O
give O
you O
the O
money O
as O
one O
gentleman O
may O
give O
money O
to O
another. O
Also, O
if O
I O
could O
be O
certain O
that O
you O
would O
leave O
both O
Homburg PERSON
and O
the O
gaming-tables, O
and O
return O
to O
your O
own O
country, O
I O
would O
give O
you O
a O
thousand O
pounds O
down O
to O
start O
life O
afresh; O
but, O
I O
give O
you O
ten O
louis O
d'or O
instead O
of O
a O
thousand O
pounds O
for O
the O
reason O
that O
at O
the O
present O
time O
a O
thousand O
pounds O
and O
ten O
louis O
d'or O
will O
be O
all O
the O
same O
to O
you--you O
will O
lose O
the O
one O
as O
readily O
as O
you O
will O
the O
other. O
Take O
the O
money, O
therefore, O
and O
good-bye." O
"Yes, O
I O
WILL O
take O
it O
if O
at O
the O
same O
time O
you O
will O
embrace O
me." O
"With O
pleasure." O
So O
we O
parted--on O
terms O
of O
sincere O
affection. O

But O
he O
was O
wrong. O
If O
I O
was O
hard O
and O
undiscerning O
as O
regards O
Polina PERSON
and O
De O
Griers, O
HE O
was O
hard O
and O
undiscerning O
as O
regards O
Russian O
people O
generally. O
Of O
myself O
I O
say O
nothing. O
Yet--yet O
words O
are O
only O
words. O
I O
need O
to O
ACT. O
Above O
all O
things O
I O
need O
to O
think O
of O
Switzerland. O
Tomorrow, O
tomorrow--Ah, O
but O
if O
only O
I O
could O
set O
things O
right O
tomorrow, O
and O
be O
born O
again, O
and O
rise O
again O
from O
the O
dead! O
But O
no--I O
cannot. O
Yet O
I O
must O
show O
her O
what O
I O
can O
do. O
Even O
if O
she O
should O
do O
no O
more O
than O
learn O
that O
I O
can O
still O
play O
the O
man, O
it O
would O
be O
worth O
it. O
Today O
it O
is O
too O
late, O
but O
TOMORROW... O
Yet O
I O
have O
a O
presentiment O
that O
things O
can O
never O
be O
otherwise. O
I O
have O
got O
fifteen O
louis O
d'or O
in O
my O
possession, O
although O
I O
began O
with O
fifteen O
gulden. O
If O
I O
were O
to O
play O
carefully O
at O
the O
start--But O
no, O
no! O
Surely O
I O
am O
not O
such O
a O
fool O
as O
that? O
Yet O
WHY O
should O
I O
not O
rise O
from O
the O
dead? O
I O
should O
require O
at O
first O
but O
to O
go O
cautiously O
and O
patiently O
and O
the O
rest O
would O
follow. O
I O
should O
require O
but O
to O
put O
a O
check O
upon O
my O
nature O
for O
one O
hour, O
and O
my O
fortunes O
would O
be O
changed O
entirely. O
Yes, O
my O
nature O
is O
my O
weak O
point. O
I O
have O
only O
to O
remember O
what O
happened O
to O
me O
some O
months O
ago O
at O
Roulettenberg, O
before O
my O
final O
ruin. O
What O
a O
notable O
instance O
that O
was O
of O
my O
capacity O
for O
resolution! O
On O
the O
occasion O
in O
question O
I O
had O
lost O
everything--everything; O
yet, O
just O
as O
I O
was O
leaving O
the O
Casino, O
I O
heard O
another O
gulden O
give O
a O
rattle O
in O
my O
pocket! O
"Perhaps O
I O
shall O
need O
it O
for O
a O
meal," O
I O
thought O
to O
myself; O
but O
a O
hundred O
paces O
further O
on, O
I O
changed O
my O
mind, O
and O
returned. O
That O
gulden O
I O
staked O
upon O
manque--and O
there O
is O
something O
in O
the O
feeling O
that, O
though O
one O
is O
alone, O
and O
in O
a O
foreign O
land, O
and O
far O
from O
one's O
own O
home O
and O
friends, O
and O
ignorant O
of O
whence O
one's O
next O
meal O
is O
to O
come, O
one O
is O
nevertheless O
staking O
one's O
very O
last O
coin! O
Well, O
I O
won O
the O
stake, O
and O
in O
twenty O
minutes O
had O
left O
the O
Casino O
with O
a O
hundred O
and O
seventy O
gulden O
in O
my O
pocket! O
That O
is O
a O
fact, O
and O
it O
shows O
what O
a O
last O
remaining O
gulden O
can O
do.... O
But O
what O
if O
my O
heart O
had O
failed O
me, O
or O
I O
had O
shrunk O
from O
making O
up O
my O
mind? O
... O
No: O
tomorrow O
all O
shall O
be O
ended! O
