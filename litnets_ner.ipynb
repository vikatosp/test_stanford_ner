      "them a welcome quite different to that which I had expected. The\r\n",

      "dismissed me to pay my respects to his sister. It was clear that from\r\n",

      "day a Monsieur Mezentsov, a French lady, and an Englishman; for,\r\n",
      "whenever money was in hand, a banquet in Muscovite style was always\r\n",
      "given. Polina Alexandrovna, on seeing me, inquired why I had been so\r\n",
      "long away. Then, without waiting for an answer, she departed. Evidently\r\n",
      "this was not mere accident, and I felt that I must throw some light\r\n",
      "upon matters. It was high time that I did so.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I was assigned a small room on the fourth floor of the hotel (for you\r\n",

      "wealth. Indeed, even before luncheon he charged me, among other things,\r\n",
      "to get two thousand-franc notes changed for him at the hotel counter,\r\n",
      "which put us in a position to be thought millionaires at all events for\r\n",

      "summons reached me from the staircase that I must attend the General.\r\n",
      "He began by deigning to inquire of me where I was going to take the\r\n",
      "children; and as he did so, I could see that he failed to look me in\r\n",
      "the eyes. He WANTED to do so, but each time was met by me with such a\r\n",
      "fixed, disrespectful stare that he desisted in confusion. In pompous\r\n",
      "language, however, which jumbled one sentence into another, and at\r\n",
      "length grew disconnected, he gave me to understand that I was to lead\r\n",
      "the children altogether away from the Casino, and out into the park.\r\n",
      "Finally his anger exploded, and he added sharply:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I suppose you would like to take them to the Casino to play roulette?\r\n",
      "Well, excuse my speaking so plainly, but I know how addicted you are to\r\n",
      "gambling. Though I am not your mentor, nor wish to be, at least I have\r\n",
      "a right to require that you shall not actually compromise me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I have no money for gambling,\" I quietly replied.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But you will soon be in receipt of some,\" retorted the General,\r\n",
      "reddening a little as he dived into his writing desk and applied\r\n",
      "himself to a memorandum book. From it he saw that he had 120 roubles of\r\n",
      "mine in his keeping.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Let us calculate,\" he went on. \"We must translate these roubles into\r\n",
      "thalers. Here--take 100 thalers, as a round sum. The rest will be safe\r\n",
      "in my hands.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In silence I took the money.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You must not be offended at what I say,\" he continued. \"You are too\r\n",

      "When returning home with the children before luncheon, I met a\r\n",
      "cavalcade of our party riding to view some ruins. Two splendid\r\n",
      "carriages, magnificently horsed, with Mlle. Blanche, Maria Philipovna,\r\n",
      "and Polina Alexandrovna in one of them, and the Frenchman, the\r\n",
      "Englishman, and the General in attendance on horseback! The passers-by\r\n",
      "stopped to stare at them, for the effect was splendid--the General\r\n",
      "could not have improved upon it. I calculated that, with the 4000\r\n",
      "francs which I had brought with me, added to what my patrons seemed\r\n",
      "already to have acquired, the party must be in possession of at least\r\n",
      "7000 or 8000 francs--though that would be none too much for Mlle.\r\n",
      "Blanche, who, with her mother and the Frenchman, was also lodging in\r\n",
      "our hotel. The latter gentleman was called by the lacqueys \"Monsieur le\r\n",
      "Comte,\" and Mlle. Blanche's mother was dubbed \"Madame la Comtesse.\"\r\n",
      "Perhaps in very truth they WERE \"Comte et Comtesse.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I knew that \"Monsieur le Comte\" would take no notice of me when we met\r\n",
      "at dinner, as also that the General would not dream of introducing us,\r\n",
      "nor of recommending me to the \"Comte.\" However, the latter had lived\r\n",
      "awhile in Russia, and knew that the person referred to as an \"uchitel\"\r\n",
      "is never looked upon as a bird of fine feather. Of course, strictly\r\n",
      "speaking, he knew me; but I was an uninvited guest at the luncheon--the\r\n",
      "General had forgotten to arrange otherwise, or I should have been\r\n",
      "dispatched to dine at the table d'hote. Nevertheless, I presented\r\n",
      "myself in such guise that the General looked at me with a touch of\r\n",
      "approval; and, though the good Maria Philipovna was for showing me my\r\n",
      "place, the fact of my having previously met the Englishman, Mr. Astley,\r\n",
      "saved me, and thenceforward I figured as one of the company.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This strange Englishman I had met first in Prussia, where we had\r\n",
      "happened to sit vis-a-vis in a railway train in which I was travelling\r\n",
      "to overtake our party; while, later, I had run across him in France,\r\n",
      "and again in Switzerland--twice within the space of two weeks! To\r\n",
      "think, therefore, that I should suddenly encounter him again here, in\r\n",
      "Roulettenberg! Never in my life had I known a more retiring man, for he\r\n",
      "was shy to the pitch of imbecility, yet well aware of the fact (for he\r\n",
      "was no fool). At the same time, he was a gentle, amiable sort of an\r\n",
      "individual, and, even on our first encounter in Prussia I had contrived\r\n",
      "to draw him out, and he had told me that he had just been to the North\r\n",
      "Cape, and was now anxious to visit the fair at Nizhni Novgorod. How he\r\n",
      "had come to make the General's acquaintance I do not know, but,\r\n",
      "apparently, he was much struck with Polina. Also, he was delighted that\r\n",
      "I should sit next him at table, for he appeared to look upon me as his\r\n",
      "bosom friend.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "During the meal the Frenchman was in great feather: he was discursive\r\n",
      "and pompous to every one. In Moscow too, I remembered, he had blown a\r\n",
      "great many bubbles. Interminably he discoursed on finance and Russian\r\n",
      "politics, and though, at times, the General made feints to contradict\r\n",
      "him, he did so humbly, and as though wishing not wholly to lose sight\r\n",
      "of his own dignity.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For myself, I was in a curious frame of mind. Even before luncheon was\r\n",
      "half finished I had asked myself the old, eternal question: \"WHY do I\r\n",
      "continue to dance attendance upon the General, instead of having left\r\n",
      "him and his family long ago?\" Every now and then I would glance at\r\n",
      "Polina Alexandrovna, but she paid me no attention; until eventually I\r\n",
      "became so irritated that I decided to play the boor.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "First of all I suddenly, and for no reason whatever, plunged loudly and\r\n",
      "gratuitously into the general conversation. Above everything I wanted\r\n",
      "to pick a quarrel with the Frenchman; and, with that end in view I\r\n",
      "turned to the General, and exclaimed in an overbearing sort of\r\n",
      "way--indeed, I think that I actually interrupted him--that that summer\r\n",
      "it had been almost impossible for a Russian to dine anywhere at tables\r\n",
      "d'hote. The General bent upon me a glance of astonishment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"If one is a man of self-respect,\" I went on, \"one risks abuse by so\r\n",
      "doing, and is forced to put up with insults of every kind. Both at\r\n",
      "Paris and on the Rhine, and even in Switzerland--there are so many\r\n",
      "Poles, with their sympathisers, the French, at these tables d'hote that\r\n",
      "one cannot get a word in edgeways if one happens only to be a Russian.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This I said in French. The General eyed me doubtfully, for he did not\r\n",
      "know whether to be angry or merely to feel surprised that I should so\r\n",
      "far forget myself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Of course, one always learns SOMETHING EVERYWHERE,\" said the Frenchman\r\n",
      "in a careless, contemptuous sort of tone.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"In Paris, too, I had a dispute with a Pole,\" I continued, \"and then\r\n",
      "with a French officer who supported him. After that a section of the\r\n",
      "Frenchmen present took my part. They did so as soon as I told them the\r\n",
      "story of how once I threatened to spit into Monsignor's coffee.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"To spit into it?\" the General inquired with grave disapproval in his\r\n",
      "tone, and a stare, of astonishment, while the Frenchman looked at me\r\n",
      "unbelievingly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Just so,\" I replied. \"You must know that, on one occasion, when, for\r\n",
      "two days, I had felt certain that at any moment I might have to depart\r\n",
      "for Rome on business, I repaired to the Embassy of the Holy See in\r\n",
      "Paris, to have my passport visaed. There I encountered a sacristan of\r\n",
      "about fifty, and a man dry and cold of mien. After listening politely,\r\n",
      "but with great reserve, to my account of myself, this sacristan asked\r\n",
      "me to wait a little. I was in a great hurry to depart, but of course I\r\n",
      "sat down, pulled out a copy of L'Opinion Nationale, and fell to reading\r\n",
      "an extraordinary piece of invective against Russia which it happened to\r\n",
      "contain. As I was thus engaged I heard some one enter an adjoining room\r\n",
      "and ask for Monsignor; after which I saw the sacristan make a low bow\r\n",
      "to the visitor, and then another bow as the visitor took his leave. I\r\n",
      "ventured to remind the good man of my own business also; whereupon,\r\n",
      "with an expression of, if anything, increased dryness, he again asked\r\n",
      "me to wait. Soon a third visitor arrived who, like myself, had come on\r\n",
      "business (he was an Austrian of some sort); and as soon as ever he had\r\n",
      "stated his errand he was conducted upstairs! This made me very angry. I\r\n",
      "rose, approached the sacristan, and told him that, since Monsignor was\r\n",
      "receiving callers, his lordship might just as well finish off my affair\r\n",
      "as well. Upon this the sacristan shrunk back in astonishment. It simply\r\n",
      "passed his understanding that any insignificant Russian should dare to\r\n",
      "compare himself with other visitors of Monsignor's! In a tone of the\r\n",
      "utmost effrontery, as though he were delighted to have a chance of\r\n",
      "insulting me, he looked me up and down, and then said: \"Do you suppose\r\n",
      "that Monsignor is going to put aside his coffee for YOU?\" But I only\r\n",
      "cried the louder: \"Let me tell you that I am going to SPIT into that\r\n",
      "coffee! Yes, and if you do not get me my passport visaed this very\r\n",
      "minute, I shall take it to Monsignor myself.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What? While he is engaged with a Cardinal?\" screeched the sacristan,\r\n",
      "again shrinking back in horror. Then, rushing to the door, he spread\r\n",
      "out his arms as though he would rather die than let me enter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thereupon I declared that I was a heretic and a barbarian--\"Je suis\r\n",
      "heretique et barbare,\" I said, \"and that these archbishops and\r\n",
      "cardinals and monsignors, and the rest of them, meant nothing at all to\r\n",
      "me. In a word, I showed him that I was not going to give way. He looked\r\n",
      "at me with an air of infinite resentment. Then he snatched up my\r\n",
      "passport, and departed with it upstairs. A minute later the passport\r\n",
      "had been visaed! Here it is now, if you care to see it,\"--and I pulled\r\n",
      "out the document, and exhibited the Roman visa.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But--\" the General began.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What really saved you was the fact that you proclaimed yourself a\r\n",
      "heretic and a barbarian,\" remarked the Frenchman with a smile. \"Cela\r\n",
      "n'etait pas si bete.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But is that how Russian subjects ought to be treated? Why, when they\r\n",
      "settle here they dare not utter even a word--they are ready even to\r\n",
      "deny the fact that they are Russians! At all events, at my hotel in\r\n",
      "Paris I received far more attention from the company after I had told\r\n",
      "them about the fracas with the sacristan. A fat Polish nobleman, who\r\n",
      "had been the most offensive of all who were present at the table\r\n",
      "d'hote, at once went upstairs, while some of the Frenchmen were simply\r\n",
      "disgusted when I told them that two years ago I had encountered a man\r\n",
      "at whom, in 1812, a French 'hero' fired for the mere fun of discharging\r\n",
      "his musket. That man was then a boy of ten and his family are still\r\n",
      "residing in Moscow.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Impossible!\" the Frenchman spluttered. \"No French soldier would fire\r\n",
      "at a child!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Nevertheless the incident was as I say,\" I replied. \"A very respected\r\n",
      "ex-captain told me the story, and I myself could see the scar left on\r\n",
      "his cheek.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Frenchman then began chattering volubly, and the General supported\r\n",
      "him; but I recommended the former to read, for example, extracts from\r\n",
      "the memoirs of General Perovski, who, in 1812, was a prisoner in the\r\n",
      "hands of the French. Finally Maria Philipovna said something to\r\n",
      "interrupt the conversation. The General was furious with me for having\r\n",
      "started the altercation with the Frenchman. On the other hand, Mr.\r\n",
      "Astley seemed to take great pleasure in my brush with Monsieur, and,\r\n",
      "rising from the table, proposed that we should go and have a drink\r\n",
      "together. The same afternoon, at four o'clock, I went to have my\r\n",
      "customary talk with Polina Alexandrovna; and, the talk soon extended to\r\n",
      "a stroll. We entered the Park, and approached the Casino, where Polina\r\n",
      "seated herself upon a bench near the fountain, and sent Nadia away to a\r\n",
      "little distance to play with some other children. Mischa also I\r\n",
      "dispatched to play by the fountain, and in this fashion we--that is to\r\n",
      "say, Polina and myself--contrived to find ourselves alone.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Of course, we began by talking on business matters. Polina seemed\r\n",
      "furious when I handed her only 700 gulden, for she had thought to\r\n",
      "receive from Paris, as the proceeds of the pledging of her diamonds, at\r\n",
      "least 2000 gulden, or even more.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Come what may, I MUST have money,\" she said. \"And get it somehow I\r\n",
      "will--otherwise I shall be ruined.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I asked her what had happened during my absence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Nothing; except that two pieces of news have reached us from St.\r\n",
      "Petersburg. In the first place, my grandmother is very ill, and\r\n",
      "unlikely to last another couple of days. We had this from Timothy\r\n",
      "Petrovitch himself, and he is a reliable person. Every moment we are\r\n",
      "expecting to receive news of the end.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"All of you are on the tiptoe of expectation?\" I queried.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Of course--all of us, and every minute of the day. For a\r\n",
      "year-and-a-half now we have been looking for this.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Looking for it?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, looking for it. I am not her blood relation, you know--I am\r\n",
      "merely the General's step-daughter.  Yet I am certain that the old lady\r\n",
      "has remembered me in her will.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, I believe that you WILL come in for a good deal,\" I said with\r\n",
      "some assurance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, for she is fond of me. But how come you to think so?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I answered this question with another one. \"That Marquis of yours,\" I\r\n",
      "said, \"--is HE also familiar with your family secrets?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And why are you yourself so interested in them?\" was her retort as she\r\n",

      "pleasure. Otherwise, is it likely that she, the cautious and clever\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "At all events, I confined myself at first simply to looking on, and\r\n",

      "do anything at all, I should do it in an absent-minded, haphazard sort\r\n",

      "of stakes or of winnings that everywhere men can be found winning, can\r\n",
      "be found depriving their fellows of something, just as they do at\r\n",
      "roulette. As to the question whether stakes and winnings are, in\r\n",
      "themselves, immoral is another question altogether, and I wish to\r\n",
      "express no opinion upon it. Yet the very fact that I was full of a\r\n",
      "strong desire to win caused this gambling for gain, in spite of its\r\n",
      "attendant squalor, to contain, if you will, something intimate,\r\n",
      "something sympathetic, to my eyes: for it is always pleasant to see men\r\n",
      "dispensing with ceremony, and acting naturally, and in an unbuttoned\r\n",
      "mood....\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Yet, why should I so deceive myself? I could see that the whole thing\r\n",
      "was a vain and unreasoning pursuit; and what, at the first glance,\r\n",
      "seemed to me the ugliest feature in this mob of roulette players was\r\n",
      "their respect for their occupation--the seriousness, and even the\r\n",
      "humility, with which they stood around the gaming tables. Moreover, I\r\n",
      "had always drawn sharp distinctions between a game which is de mauvais\r\n",
      "genre and a game which is permissible to a decent man. In fact, there\r\n",
      "are two sorts of gaming--namely, the game of the gentleman and the game\r\n",
      "of the plebs--the game for gain, and the game of the herd. Herein, as\r\n",
      "said, I draw sharp distinctions. Yet how essentially base are the\r\n",
      "distinctions! For instance, a gentleman may stake, say, five or ten\r\n",
      "louis d'or--seldom more, unless he is a very rich man, when he may\r\n",
      "stake, say, a thousand francs; but, he must do this simply for the love\r\n",
      "of the game itself--simply for sport, simply in order to observe the\r\n",
      "process of winning or of losing, and, above all things, as a man who\r\n",
      "remains quite uninterested in the possibility of his issuing a winner.\r\n",
      "If he wins, he will be at liberty, perhaps, to give vent to a laugh, or\r\n",
      "to pass a remark on the circumstance to a bystander, or to stake again,\r\n",
      "or to double his stake; but, even this he must do solely out of\r\n",
      "curiosity, and for the pleasure of watching the play of chances and of\r\n",
      "calculations, and not because of any vulgar desire to win. In a word,\r\n",
      "he must look upon the gaming-table, upon roulette, and upon trente et\r\n",
      "quarante, as mere relaxations which have been arranged solely for his\r\n",
      "amusement. Of the existence of the lures and gains upon which the bank\r\n",
      "is founded and maintained he must profess to have not an inkling. Best\r\n",
      "of all, he ought to imagine his fellow-gamblers and the rest of the mob\r\n",
      "which stands trembling over a coin to be equally rich and gentlemanly\r\n",
      "with himself, and playing solely for recreation and pleasure. This\r\n",
      "complete ignorance of the realities, this innocent view of mankind, is\r\n",
      "what, in my opinion, constitutes the truly aristocratic. For instance,\r\n",
      "I have seen even fond mothers so far indulge their guileless, elegant\r\n",
      "daughters--misses of fifteen or sixteen--as to give them a few gold\r\n",
      "coins and teach them how to play; and though the young ladies may have\r\n",
      "won or have lost, they have invariably laughed, and departed as though\r\n",
      "they were well pleased. In the same way, I saw our General once\r\n",
      "approach the table in a stolid, important manner. A lacquey darted to\r\n",
      "offer him a chair, but the General did not even notice him. Slowly he\r\n",
      "took out his money bags, and slowly extracted 300 francs in gold, which\r\n",
      "he staked on the black, and won. Yet he did not take up his\r\n",
      "winnings--he left them there on the table. Again the black turned up,\r\n",
      "and again he did not gather in what he had won; and when, in the third\r\n",
      "round, the RED turned up he lost, at a stroke, 1200 francs. Yet even\r\n",
      "then he rose with a smile, and thus preserved his reputation; yet I\r\n",
      "knew that his money bags must be chafing his heart, as well as that,\r\n",
      "had the stake been twice or thrice as much again, he would still have\r\n",
      "restrained himself from venting his disappointment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On the other hand, I saw a Frenchman first win, and then lose, 30,000\r\n",
      "francs cheerfully, and without a murmur. Yes; even if a gentleman\r\n",
      "should lose his whole substance, he must never give way to annoyance.\r\n",
      "Money must be so subservient to gentility as never to be worth a\r\n",
      "thought.  Of course, the SUPREMELY aristocratic thing is to be entirely\r\n",
      "oblivious of the mire of rabble, with its setting; but sometimes a\r\n",
      "reverse course may be aristocratic to remark, to scan, and even to gape\r\n",
      "at, the mob (for preference, through a lorgnette), even as though one\r\n",
      "were taking the crowd and its squalor for a sort of raree show which\r\n",
      "had been organised specially for a gentleman's diversion. Though one\r\n",
      "may be squeezed by the crowd, one must look as though one were fully\r\n",
      "assured of being the observer--of having neither part nor lot with the\r\n",
      "observed. At the same time, to stare fixedly about one is unbecoming;\r\n",
      "for that, again, is ungentlemanly, seeing that no spectacle is worth an\r\n",
      "open stare--are no spectacles in the world which merit from a gentleman\r\n",
      "too pronounced an inspection.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "However, to me personally the scene DID seem to be worth undisguised\r\n",
      "contemplation--more especially in view of the fact that I had come\r\n",
      "there not only to look at, but also to number myself sincerely and\r\n",
      "wholeheartedly with, the mob. As for my secret moral views, I had no\r\n",
      "room for them amongst my actual, practical opinions. Let that stand as\r\n",
      "written: I am writing only to relieve my conscience. Yet let me say\r\n",
      "also this: that from the first I have been consistent in having an\r\n",
      "intense aversion to any trial of my acts and thoughts by a moral\r\n",
      "standard. Another standard altogether has directed my life....\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As a matter of fact, the mob was playing in exceedingly foul fashion.\r\n",
      "Indeed, I have an idea that sheer robbery was going on around that\r\n",
      "gaming-table. The croupiers who sat at the two ends of it had not only\r\n",
      "to watch the stakes, but also to calculate the game--an immense amount\r\n",
      "of work for two men! As for the crowd itself--well, it consisted mostly\r\n",
      "of Frenchmen. Yet I was not then taking notes merely in order to be\r\n",
      "able to give you a description of roulette, but in order to get my\r\n",
      "bearings as to my behaviour when I myself should begin to play. For\r\n",
      "example, I noticed that nothing was more common than for another's hand\r\n",
      "to stretch out and grab one's winnings whenever one had won. Then there\r\n",
      "would arise a dispute, and frequently an uproar; and it would be a case\r\n",
      "of \"I beg of you to prove, and to produce witnesses to the fact, that\r\n",
      "the stake is yours.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At first the proceedings were pure Greek to me. I could only divine and\r\n",
      "distinguish that stakes were hazarded on numbers, on \"odd\" or \"even,\"\r\n",
      "and on colours. Polina's money I decided to risk, that evening, only to\r\n",
      "the amount of 100 gulden. The thought that I was not going to play for\r\n",
      "myself quite unnerved me. It was an unpleasant sensation, and I tried\r\n",
      "hard to banish it. I had a feeling that, once I had begun to play for\r\n",
      "Polina, I should wreck my own fortunes. Also, I wonder if any one has\r\n",
      "EVER approached a gaming-table without falling an immediate prey to\r\n",
      "superstition? I began by pulling out fifty gulden, and staking them on\r\n",
      "\"even.\" The wheel spun and stopped at 13. I had lost! With a feeling\r\n",
      "like a sick qualm, as though I would like to make my way out of the\r\n",
      "crowd and go home, I staked another fifty gulden--this time on the red.\r\n",
      "The red turned up. Next time I staked the 100 gulden just where they\r\n",
      "lay--and again the red turned up. Again I staked the whole sum, and\r\n",
      "again the red turned up. Clutching my 400 gulden, I placed 200 of them\r\n",
      "on twelve figures, to see what would come of it. The result was that\r\n",
      "the croupier paid me out three times my total stake! Thus from 100\r\n",
      "gulden my store had grown to 800! Upon that such a curious, such an\r\n",
      "inexplicable, unwonted feeling overcame me that I decided to depart.\r\n",
      "Always the thought kept recurring to me that if I had been playing for\r\n",
      "myself alone I should never have had such luck. Once more I staked the\r\n",
      "whole 800 gulden on the \"even.\" The wheel stopped at 4. I was paid out\r\n",
      "another 800 gulden, and, snatching up my pile of 1600, departed in\r\n",
      "search of Polina  Alexandrovna.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I found the whole party walking in the park, and was able to get an\r\n",
      "interview with her only after supper. This time the Frenchman was\r\n",
      "absent from the meal, and the General seemed to be in a more expansive\r\n",
      "vein. Among other things, he thought it necessary to remind me that he\r\n",
      "would be sorry to see me playing at the gaming-tables. In his opinion,\r\n",
      "such conduct would greatly compromise him--especially if I were to lose\r\n",
      "much. \"And even if you were to WIN much I should be compromised,\" he\r\n",
      "added in a meaning sort of way. \"Of course I have no RIGHT to order\r\n",
      "your actions, but you yourself will agree that...\" As usual, he did not\r\n",
      "finish his sentence. I answered drily that I had very little money in\r\n",
      "my possession, and that, consequently, I was hardly in a position to\r\n",
      "indulge in any conspicuous play, even if I did gamble. At last, when\r\n",
      "ascending to my own room, I succeeded in handing Polina her winnings,\r\n",
      "and told her that, next time, I should not play for her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why not?\" she asked excitedly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Because I wish to play FOR MYSELF,\" I replied with a feigned glance of\r\n",
      "astonishment. \"That is my sole reason.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then are you so certain that your roulette-playing will get us out of\r\n",
      "our difficulties?\" she inquired with a quizzical smile.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I said very seriously, \"Yes,\" and then added: \"Possibly my certainty\r\n",
      "about winning may seem to you ridiculous; yet, pray leave me in peace.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nonetheless she insisted that I ought to go halves with her in the\r\n",
      "day's winnings, and offered me 800 gulden on condition that henceforth,\r\n",
      "I gambled only on those terms; but I refused to do so, once and for\r\n",
      "all--stating, as my reason, that I found myself unable to play on\r\n",
      "behalf of any one else, \"I am not unwilling so to do,\" I added, \"but in\r\n",
      "all probability I should lose.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, absurd though it be, I place great hopes on your playing of\r\n",
      "roulette,\" she remarked musingly; \"wherefore, you ought to play as my\r\n",
      "partner and on equal shares; wherefore, of course, you will do as I\r\n",
      "wish.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then she left me without listening to any further protests on my part.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "III\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On the morrow she said not a word to me about gambling. In fact, she\r\n",
      "purposely avoided me, although her old manner to me had not changed:\r\n",
      "the same serene coolness was hers on meeting me--a coolness that was\r\n",
      "mingled even with a spice of contempt and dislike. In short, she was at\r\n",
      "no pains to conceal her aversion to me. That I could see plainly. Also,\r\n",
      "she did not trouble to conceal from me the fact that I was necessary to\r\n",
      "her, and that she was keeping me for some end which she had in view.\r\n",
      "Consequently there became established between us relations which, to a\r\n",
      "large extent, were incomprehensible to me, considering her general\r\n",
      "pride and aloofness. For example, although she knew that I was madly in\r\n",
      "love with her, she allowed me to speak to her of my passion (though she\r\n",
      "could not well have showed her contempt for me more than by permitting\r\n",
      "me, unhindered and unrebuked, to mention to her my love).\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You see,\" her attitude expressed, \"how little I regard your feelings,\r\n",
      "as well as how little I care for what you say to me, or for what you\r\n",
      "feel for me.\" Likewise, though she spoke as before concerning her\r\n",
      "affairs, it was never with complete frankness. In her contempt for me\r\n",
      "there were refinements. Although she knew well that I was aware of a\r\n",
      "certain circumstance in her life of something which might one day cause\r\n",
      "her trouble, she would speak to me about her affairs (whenever she had\r\n",
      "need of me for a given end) as though I were a slave or a passing\r\n",
      "acquaintance--yet tell them me only in so far as one would need to know\r\n",
      "them if one were going to be made temporary use of. Had I not known the\r\n",
      "whole chain of events, or had she not seen how much I was pained and\r\n",
      "disturbed by her teasing insistency, she would never have thought it\r\n",
      "worthwhile to soothe me with this frankness--even though, since she not\r\n",
      "infrequently used me to execute commissions that were not only\r\n",
      "troublesome, but risky, she ought, in my opinion, to have been frank in\r\n",
      "ANY case. But, forsooth, it was not worth her while to trouble about MY\r\n",
      "feelings--about the fact that I was uneasy, and, perhaps, thrice as put\r\n",
      "about by her cares and misfortunes as she was herself!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For three weeks I had known of her intention to take to roulette. She\r\n",
      "had even warned me that she would like me to play on her behalf, since\r\n",
      "it was unbecoming for her to play in person; and, from the tone of her\r\n",
      "words I had gathered that there was something on her mind besides a\r\n",
      "mere desire to win money. As if money could matter to HER! No, she had\r\n",
      "some end in view, and there were circumstances at which I could guess,\r\n",
      "but which I did not know for certain. True, the slavery and abasement\r\n",
      "in which she held me might have given me (such things often do so) the\r\n",
      "power to question her with abrupt directness (seeing that, inasmuch as\r\n",
      "I figured in her eyes as a mere slave and nonentity, she could not very\r\n",
      "well have taken offence at any rude curiosity); but the fact was that,\r\n",
      "though she let me question her, she never returned me a single answer,\r\n",
      "and at times did not so much as notice me. That is how matters stood.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Next day there was a good deal of talk about a telegram which, four\r\n",
      "days ago, had been sent to St. Petersburg, but to which there had come\r\n",
      "no answer. The General was visibly disturbed and moody, for the matter\r\n",
      "concerned his mother. The Frenchman, too, was excited, and after dinner\r\n",
      "the whole party talked long and seriously together--the Frenchman's\r\n",
      "tone being extraordinarily presumptuous and offhand to everybody. It\r\n",
      "almost reminded one of the proverb, \"Invite a man to your table, and\r\n",
      "soon he will place his feet upon it.\" Even to Polina he was brusque\r\n",
      "almost to the point of rudeness. Yet still he seemed glad to join us in\r\n",
      "our walks in the Casino, or in our rides and drives about the town. I\r\n",
      "had long been aware of certain circumstances which bound the General to\r\n",
      "him; I had long been aware that in Russia they had hatched some scheme\r\n",
      "together although I did not know whether the plot had come to anything,\r\n",
      "or whether it was still only in the stage of being talked of. Likewise\r\n",
      "I was aware, in part, of a family secret--namely, that, last year, the\r\n",
      "Frenchman had bailed the General out of debt, and given him 30,000\r\n",
      "roubles wherewith to pay his Treasury dues on retiring from the\r\n",
      "service. And now, of course, the General was in a vice--although the\r\n",
      "chief part in the affair was being played by Mlle. Blanche. Yes, of\r\n",
      "this last I had no doubt.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But WHO was this Mlle. Blanche? It was said of her that she was a\r\n",
      "Frenchwoman of good birth who, living with her mother, possessed a\r\n",
      "colossal fortune. It was also said that she was some relation to the\r\n",
      "Marquis, but only a distant one a cousin, or cousin-german, or\r\n",
      "something of the sort. Likewise I knew that, up to the time of my\r\n",
      "journey to Paris, she and the Frenchman had been more ceremonious\r\n",
      "towards our party--they had stood on a much more precise and delicate\r\n",
      "footing with them; but that now their acquaintanceship--their\r\n",
      "friendship, their intimacy--had taken on a much more off-hand and\r\n",
      "rough-and-ready air. Perhaps they thought that our means were too\r\n",
      "modest for them, and, therefore, unworthy of politeness or reticence.\r\n",
      "Also, for the last three days I had noticed certain looks which Astley\r\n",
      "had kept throwing at Mlle. Blanche and her mother; and it had occurred\r\n",
      "to me that he must have had some previous acquaintance with the pair. I\r\n",
      "had even surmised that the Frenchman too must have met Mr. Astley\r\n",
      "before. Astley was a man so shy, reserved, and taciturn in his manner\r\n",
      "that one might have looked for anything from him. At all events the\r\n",
      "Frenchman accorded him only the slightest of greetings, and scarcely\r\n",
      "even looked at him. Certainly he did not seem to be afraid of him;\r\n",
      "which was intelligible enough. But why did Mlle. Blanche also never\r\n",
      "look at the Englishman?--particularly since, a propos of something or\r\n",
      "another, the Marquis had declared the Englishman to be immensely and\r\n",
      "indubitably rich? Was not that a sufficient reason to make Mlle.\r\n",
      "Blanche look at the Englishman? Anyway the General seemed extremely\r\n",
      "uneasy; and, one could well understand what a telegram to announce the\r\n",
      "death of his mother would mean for him!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Although I thought it probable that Polina was avoiding me for a\r\n",
      "definite reason, I adopted a cold and indifferent air; for I felt\r\n",
      "pretty certain that it would not be long before she herself approached\r\n",
      "me. For two days, therefore, I devoted my attention to Mlle. Blanche.\r\n",
      "The poor General was in despair! To fall in love at fifty-five, and\r\n",
      "with such vehemence, is indeed a misfortune! And add to that his\r\n",
      "widowerhood, his children, his ruined property, his debts, and the\r\n",
      "woman with whom he had fallen in love! Though Mlle. Blanche was\r\n",
      "extremely good-looking, I may or may not be understood when I say that\r\n",
      "she had one of those faces which one is afraid of. At all events, I\r\n",
      "myself have always feared such women. Apparently about twenty-five\r\n",
      "years of age, she was tall and broad-shouldered, with shoulders that\r\n",
      "sloped; yet though her neck and bosom were ample in their proportions,\r\n",
      "her skin was dull yellow in colour, while her hair (which was extremely\r\n",
      "abundant--sufficient to make two coiffures) was as black as Indian ink.\r\n",
      "Add to that a pair of black eyes with yellowish whites, a proud glance,\r\n",
      "gleaming teeth, and lips which were perennially pomaded and redolent of\r\n",
      "musk. As for her dress, it was invariably rich, effective, and chic,\r\n",
      "yet in good taste. Lastly, her feet and hands were astonishing, and her\r\n",
      "voice a deep contralto. Sometimes, when she laughed, she displayed her\r\n",
      "teeth, but at ordinary times her air was taciturn and\r\n",
      "haughty--especially in the presence of Polina and Maria Philipovna. Yet\r\n",
      "she seemed to me almost destitute of education, and even of wits,\r\n",
      "though cunning and suspicious. This, apparently, was not because her\r\n",
      "life had been lacking in incident. Perhaps, if all were known, the\r\n",
      "Marquis was not her kinsman at all, nor her mother, her mother; but\r\n",
      "there was evidence that, in Berlin, where we had first come across the\r\n",
      "pair, they had possessed acquaintances of good standing. As for the\r\n",
      "Marquis himself, I doubt to this day if he was a Marquis--although\r\n",
      "about the fact that he had formerly belonged to high society (for\r\n",
      "instance, in Moscow and Germany) there could be no doubt whatever. What\r\n",
      "he had formerly been in France I had not a notion. All I knew was that\r\n",
      "he was said to possess a chateau. During the last two weeks I had\r\n",
      "looked for much to transpire, but am still ignorant whether at that\r\n",
      "time anything decisive ever passed between Mademoiselle and the\r\n",
      "General. Everything seemed to depend upon our means--upon whether the\r\n",
      "General would be able to flourish sufficient money in her face. If ever\r\n",
      "the news should arrive that the grandmother was not dead, Mlle.\r\n",
      "Blanche, I felt sure, would disappear in a twinkling. Indeed, it\r\n",
      "surprised and amused me to observe what a passion for intrigue I was\r\n",
      "developing. But how I loathed it all! With what pleasure would I have\r\n",
      "given everybody and everything the go-by! Only--I could not leave\r\n",
      "Polina. How, then, could I show contempt for those who surrounded her?\r\n",
      "Espionage is a base thing, but--what have I to do with that?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Astley, too, I found a curious person. I was only sure that he had\r\n",
      "fallen in love with Polina. A remarkable and diverting circumstance is\r\n",
      "the amount which may lie in the mien of a shy and painfully modest man\r\n",
      "who has been touched with the divine passion--especially when he would\r\n",
      "rather sink into the earth than betray himself by a single word or\r\n",
      "look. Though Mr. Astley frequently met us when we were out walking, he\r\n",
      "would merely take off his hat and pass us by, though I knew he was\r\n",
      "dying to join us. Even when invited to do so, he would refuse. Again,\r\n",
      "in places of amusement--in the Casino, at concerts, or near the\r\n",
      "fountain--he was never far from the spot where we were sitting. In\r\n",
      "fact, WHEREVER we were in the Park, in the forest, or on the\r\n",
      "Shlangenberg--one needed but to raise one's eyes and glance around to\r\n",
      "catch sight of at least a PORTION of Mr. Astley's frame sticking\r\n",
      "out--whether on an adjacent path or behind a bush. Yet never did he\r\n",
      "lose any chance of speaking to myself; and, one morning when we had\r\n",
      "met, and exchanged a couple of words, he burst out in his usual abrupt\r\n",
      "way, without saying \"Good-morning.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That Mlle. Blanche,\" he said. \"Well, I have seen a good many women\r\n",
      "like her.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After that he was silent as he looked me meaningly in the face. What he\r\n",
      "meant I did not know, but to my glance of inquiry he returned only a\r\n",
      "dry nod, and a reiterated \"It is so.\" Presently, however, he resumed:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Does Mlle. Polina like flowers?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I really cannot say,\" was my reply.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What? You cannot say?\" he cried in great astonishment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No; I have never noticed whether she does so or not,\" I repeated with\r\n",
      "a smile.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Hm! Then I have an idea in my mind,\" he concluded. Lastly, with a nod,\r\n",
      "he walked away with a pleased expression on his face. The conversation\r\n",
      "had been carried on in execrable French.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "IV\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Today has been a day of folly, stupidity, and ineptness. The time is\r\n",
      "now eleven o'clock in the evening, and I am sitting in my room and\r\n",
      "thinking. It all began, this morning, with my being forced to go and\r\n",
      "play roulette for Polina Alexandrovna. When she handed me over her\r\n",
      "store of six hundred gulden I exacted two conditions--namely, that I\r\n",
      "should not go halves with her in her winnings, if any (that is to say,\r\n",
      "I should not take anything for myself), and that she should explain to\r\n",
      "me, that same evening, why it was so necessary for her to win, and how\r\n",
      "much was the sum which she needed. For, I could not suppose that she\r\n",
      "was doing all this merely for the sake of money. Yet clearly she did\r\n",
      "need some money, and that as soon as possible, and for a special\r\n",
      "purpose. Well, she promised to explain matters, and I departed. There\r\n",
      "was a tremendous crowd in the gaming-rooms. What an arrogant, greedy\r\n",
      "crowd it was! I pressed forward towards the middle of the room until I\r\n",
      "had secured a seat at a croupier's elbow. Then I began to play in timid\r\n",
      "fashion, venturing only twenty or thirty gulden at a time. Meanwhile, I\r\n",
      "observed and took notes. It seemed to me that calculation was\r\n",
      "superfluous, and by no means possessed of the importance which certain\r\n",
      "other players attached to it, even though they sat with ruled papers in\r\n",
      "their hands, whereon they set down the coups, calculated the chances,\r\n",
      "reckoned, staked, and--lost exactly as we more simple mortals did who\r\n",
      "played without any reckoning at all.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "However, I deduced from the scene one conclusion which seemed to me\r\n",
      "reliable--namely, that in the flow of fortuitous chances there is, if\r\n",
      "not a system, at all events a sort of order. This, of course, is a very\r\n",
      "strange thing. For instance, after a dozen middle figures there would\r\n",
      "always occur a dozen or so outer ones. Suppose the ball stopped twice\r\n",
      "at a dozen outer figures; it would then pass to a dozen of the first\r\n",
      "ones, and then, again, to a dozen of the middle ciphers, and fall upon\r\n",
      "them three or four times, and then revert to a dozen outers; whence,\r\n",
      "after another couple of rounds, the ball would again pass to the first\r\n",
      "figures, strike upon them once, and then return thrice to the middle\r\n",
      "series--continuing thus for an hour and a half, or two hours. One,\r\n",
      "three, two: one, three, two. It was all very curious. Again, for the\r\n",
      "whole of a day or a morning the red would alternate with the black, but\r\n",
      "almost without any order, and from moment to moment, so that scarcely\r\n",
      "two consecutive rounds would end upon either the one or the other. Yet,\r\n",
      "next day, or, perhaps, the next evening, the red alone would turn up,\r\n",
      "and attain a run of over two score, and continue so for quite a length\r\n",
      "of time--say, for a whole day. Of these circumstances the majority were\r\n",
      "pointed out to me by Mr. Astley, who stood by the gaming-table the\r\n",
      "whole morning, yet never once staked in person.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For myself, I lost all that I had on me, and with great speed. To begin\r\n",
      "with, I staked two hundred gulden on \"even,\" and won. Then I staked the\r\n",
      "same amount again, and won: and so on some two or three times. At one\r\n",
      "moment I must have had in my hands--gathered there within a space of\r\n",
      "five minutes--about 4000 gulden. That, of course, was the proper moment\r\n",
      "for me to have departed, but there arose in me a strange sensation as\r\n",
      "of a challenge to Fate--as of a wish to deal her a blow on the cheek,\r\n",
      "and to put out my tongue at her. Accordingly I set down the largest\r\n",
      "stake allowed by the rules--namely, 4000 gulden--and lost. Fired by\r\n",
      "this mishap, I pulled out all the money left to me, staked it all on\r\n",
      "the same venture, and--again lost! Then I rose from the table, feeling\r\n",
      "as though I were stupefied. What had happened to me I did not know;\r\n",
      "but, before luncheon I told Polina of my losses--until which time I\r\n",
      "walked about the Park.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At luncheon I was as excited as I had been at the meal three days ago.\r\n",
      "Mlle. Blanche and the Frenchman were lunching with us, and it appeared\r\n",
      "that the former had been to the Casino that morning, and had seen my\r\n",
      "exploits there. So now she showed me more attention when talking to me;\r\n",
      "while, for his part, the Frenchman approached me, and asked outright if\r\n",
      "it had been my own money that I had lost. He appeared to be suspicious\r\n",
      "as to something being on foot between Polina and myself, but I merely\r\n",
      "fired up, and replied that the money had been all my own.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At this the General seemed extremely surprised, and asked me whence I\r\n",
      "had procured it; whereupon I replied that, though I had begun only with\r\n",
      "100 gulden, six or seven rounds had increased my capital to 5000 or\r\n",
      "6000 gulden, and that subsequently I had lost the whole in two rounds.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "All this, of course, was plausible enough. During my recital I glanced\r\n",
      "at Polina, but nothing was to be discerned on her face. However, she\r\n",
      "had allowed me to fire up without correcting me, and from that I\r\n",
      "concluded that it was my cue to fire up, and to conceal the fact that I\r\n",
      "had been playing on her behalf. \"At all events,\" I thought to myself,\r\n",
      "\"she, in her turn, has promised to give me an explanation to-night, and\r\n",
      "to reveal to me something or another.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Although the General appeared to be taking stock of me, he said\r\n",
      "nothing. Yet I could see uneasiness and annoyance in his face. Perhaps\r\n",
      "his straitened circumstances made it hard for him to have to hear of\r\n",
      "piles of gold passing through the hands of an irresponsible fool like\r\n",
      "myself within the space of a quarter of an hour. Now, I have an idea\r\n",
      "that, last night, he and the Frenchman had a sharp encounter with one\r\n",
      "another. At all events they closeted themselves together, and then had\r\n",
      "a long and vehement discussion; after which the Frenchman departed in\r\n",
      "what appeared to be a passion, but returned, early this morning, to\r\n",
      "renew the combat. On hearing of my losses, however, he only remarked\r\n",
      "with a sharp, and even a malicious, air that \"a man ought to go more\r\n",
      "carefully.\" Next, for some reason or another, he added that, \"though a\r\n",
      "great many Russians go in for gambling, they are no good at the game.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I think that roulette was devised specially for Russians,\" I retorted;\r\n",
      "and when the Frenchman smiled contemptuously at my reply I further\r\n",
      "remarked that I was sure I was right; also that, speaking of Russians\r\n",
      "in the capacity of gamblers, I had far more blame for them than\r\n",
      "praise--of that he could be quite sure.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Upon what do you base your opinion?\" he inquired.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Upon the fact that to the virtues and merits of the civilised\r\n",
      "Westerner there has become historically added--though this is not his\r\n",
      "chief point--a capacity for acquiring capital; whereas, not only is the\r\n",
      "Russian incapable of acquiring capital, but also he exhausts it\r\n",
      "wantonly and of sheer folly. None the less we Russians often need\r\n",
      "money; wherefore, we are glad of, and greatly devoted to, a method of\r\n",
      "acquisition like roulette--whereby, in a couple of hours, one may grow\r\n",
      "rich without doing any work. This method, I repeat, has a great\r\n",
      "attraction for us, but since we play in wanton fashion, and without\r\n",
      "taking any trouble, we almost invariably lose.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"To a certain extent that is true,\" assented the Frenchman with a\r\n",
      "self-satisfied air.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh no, it is not true,\" put in the General sternly. \"And you,\" he\r\n",
      "added to me, \"you ought to be ashamed of yourself for traducing your\r\n",
      "own country!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I beg pardon,\" I said. \"Yet it would be difficult to say which is the\r\n",
      "worst of the two--Russian ineptitude or the German method of growing\r\n",
      "rich through honest toil.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What an extraordinary idea,\" cried the General.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And what a RUSSIAN idea!\" added the Frenchman.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I smiled, for I was rather glad to have a quarrel with them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I would rather live a wandering life in tents,\" I cried, \"than bow the\r\n",
      "knee to a German idol!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"To WHAT idol?\" exclaimed the General, now seriously angry.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"To the German method of heaping up riches. I have not been here very\r\n",
      "long, but I can tell you that what I have seen and verified makes my\r\n",
      "Tartar blood boil. Good Lord! I wish for no virtues of that kind.\r\n",
      "Yesterday I went for a walk of about ten versts; and, everywhere I\r\n",
      "found that things were even as we read of them in good German\r\n",
      "picture-books--that every house has its 'Fater,' who is horribly\r\n",
      "beneficent and extraordinarily honourable. So honourable is he that it\r\n",
      "is dreadful to have anything to do with him; and I cannot bear people\r\n",
      "of that sort. Each such 'Fater' has his family, and in the evenings\r\n",
      "they read improving books aloud. Over their roof-trees there murmur\r\n",
      "elms and chestnuts; the sun has sunk to his rest; a stork is roosting\r\n",
      "on the gable; and all is beautifully poetic and touching. Do not be\r\n",
      "angry, General. Let me tell you something that is even more touching\r\n",
      "than that. I can remember how, of an evening, my own father, now dead,\r\n",
      "used to sit under the lime trees in his little garden, and to read\r\n",
      "books aloud to myself and my mother. Yes, I know how things ought to be\r\n",
      "done. Yet every German family is bound to slavery and to submission to\r\n",
      "its 'Fater.' They work like oxen, and amass wealth like Jews. Suppose\r\n",
      "the 'Fater' has put by a certain number of gulden which he hands over\r\n",
      "to his eldest son, in order that the said son may acquire a trade or a\r\n",
      "small plot of land. Well, one result is to deprive the daughter of a\r\n",
      "dowry, and so leave her among the unwedded. For the same reason, the\r\n",
      "parents will have to sell the younger son into bondage or the ranks of\r\n",
      "the army, in order that he may earn more towards the family capital.\r\n",
      "Yes, such things ARE done, for I have been making inquiries on the\r\n",
      "subject. It is all done out of sheer rectitude--out of a rectitude\r\n",
      "which is magnified to the point of the younger son believing that he\r\n",
      "has been RIGHTLY sold, and that it is simply idyllic for the victim to\r\n",
      "rejoice when he is made over into pledge. What more have I to tell?\r\n",
      "Well, this--that matters bear just as hardly upon the eldest son.\r\n",
      "Perhaps he has his Gretchen to whom his heart is bound; but he cannot\r\n",
      "marry her, for the reason that he has not yet amassed sufficient\r\n",
      "gulden. So, the pair wait on in a mood of sincere and virtuous\r\n",
      "expectation, and smilingly deposit themselves in pawn the while.\r\n",
      "Gretchen's cheeks grow sunken, and she begins to wither; until at last,\r\n",
      "after some twenty years, their substance has multiplied, and sufficient\r\n",
      "gulden have been honourably and virtuously accumulated. Then the\r\n",
      "'Fater' blesses his forty-year-old heir and the thirty-five-year-old\r\n",
      "Gretchen with the sunken bosom and the scarlet nose; after which he\r\n",
      "bursts, into tears, reads the pair a lesson on morality, and dies. In\r\n",
      "turn the eldest son becomes a virtuous 'Fater,' and the old story\r\n",
      "begins again. In fifty or sixty years' time the grandson of the\r\n",
      "original 'Fater' will have amassed a considerable sum; and that sum he\r\n",
      "will hand over to, his son, and the latter to HIS son, and so on for\r\n",
      "several generations; until at length there will issue a Baron\r\n",
      "Rothschild, or a 'Hoppe and Company,' or the devil knows what! Is it\r\n",
      "not a beautiful spectacle--the spectacle of a century or two of\r\n",
      "inherited labour, patience, intellect, rectitude, character,\r\n",
      "perseverance, and calculation, with a stork sitting on the roof above\r\n",
      "it all? What is more; they think there can never be anything better\r\n",
      "than this; wherefore, from their point of view they begin to judge the\r\n",
      "rest of the world, and to censure all who are at fault--that is to say,\r\n",
      "who are not exactly like themselves. Yes, there you have it in a\r\n",
      "nutshell. For my own part, I would rather grow fat after the Russian\r\n",
      "manner, or squander my whole substance at roulette. I have no wish to\r\n",
      "be 'Hoppe and Company' at the end of five generations. I want the money\r\n",
      "for MYSELF, for in no way do I look upon my personality as necessary\r\n",
      "to, or meet to be given over to, capital. I may be wrong, but there you\r\n",
      "have it. Those are MY views.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"How far you may be right in what you have said I do not know,\"\r\n",
      "remarked the General moodily; \"but I DO know that you are becoming an\r\n",
      "insufferable farceur whenever you are given the least chance.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As usual, he left his sentence unfinished. Indeed, whenever he embarked\r\n",
      "upon anything that in the least exceeded the limits of daily\r\n",
      "small-talk, he left unfinished what he was saying. The Frenchman had\r\n",
      "listened to me contemptuously, with a slight protruding of his eyes;\r\n",
      "but, he could not have understood very much of my harangue. As for\r\n",
      "Polina, she had looked on with serene indifference. She seemed to have\r\n",
      "heard neither my voice nor any other during the progress of the meal.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "V\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Yes, she had been extraordinarily meditative. Yet, on leaving the\r\n",
      "table, she immediately ordered me to accompany her for a walk. We took\r\n",
      "the children with us, and set out for the fountain in the Park.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I was in such an irritated frame of mind that in rude and abrupt\r\n",
      "fashion I blurted out a question as to \"why our Marquis de Griers had\r\n",
      "ceased to accompany her for strolls, or to speak to her for days\r\n",
      "together.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Because he is a brute,\" she replied in rather a curious way. It was\r\n",
      "the first time that I had heard her speak so of De Griers:\r\n",
      "consequently, I was momentarily awed into silence by this expression of\r\n",
      "resentment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Have you noticed, too, that today he is by no means on good terms with\r\n",
      "the General?\" I went on.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes--and I suppose you want to know why,\" she replied with dry\r\n",
      "captiousness. \"You are aware, are you not, that the General is\r\n",
      "mortgaged to the Marquis, with all his property? Consequently, if the\r\n",
      "General's mother does not die, the Frenchman will become the absolute\r\n",
      "possessor of everything which he now holds only in pledge.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then it is really the case that everything is mortgaged? I have heard\r\n",
      "rumours to that effect, but was unaware how far they might be true.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, they ARE true. What then?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why, it will be a case of 'Farewell, Mlle. Blanche,'\" I remarked; \"for\r\n",
      "in such an event she would never become Madame General. Do you know, I\r\n",
      "believe the old man is so much in love with her that he will shoot\r\n",
      "himself if she should throw him over. At his age it is a dangerous\r\n",
      "thing to fall in love.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, something, I believe, WILL happen to him,\" assented Polina\r\n",
      "thoughtfully.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And what a fine thing it all is!\" I continued. \"Could anything be more\r\n",
      "abominable than the way in which she has agreed to marry for money\r\n",
      "alone? Not one of the decencies has been observed; the whole affair has\r\n",
      "taken place without the least ceremony. And as for the grandmother,\r\n",
      "what could be more comical, yet more dastardly, than the sending of\r\n",
      "telegram after telegram to know if she is dead? What do you think of\r\n",
      "it, Polina Alexandrovna?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, it is very horrible,\" she interrupted with a shudder.\r\n",
      "\"Consequently, I am the more surprised that YOU should be so cheerful.\r\n",
      "What are YOU so pleased about? About the fact that you have gone and\r\n",
      "lost my money?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What? The money that you gave me to lose? I told you I should never\r\n",
      "win for other people--least of all for you. I obeyed you simply because\r\n",
      "you ordered me to; but you must not blame me for the result. I warned\r\n",
      "you that no good would ever come of it. You seem much depressed at\r\n",
      "having lost your money. Why do you need it so greatly?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why do YOU ask me these questions?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Because you promised to explain matters to me. Listen. I am certain\r\n",
      "that, as soon as ever I 'begin to play for myself' (and I still have\r\n",
      "120 gulden left), I shall win. You can then take of me what you\r\n",
      "require.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She made a contemptuous grimace.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You must not be angry with me,\" I continued, \"for making such a\r\n",
      "proposal. I am so conscious of being only a nonentity in your eyes that\r\n",
      "you need not mind accepting money from me. A gift from me could not\r\n",
      "possibly offend you. Moreover, it was I who lost your gulden.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She glanced at me, but, seeing that I was in an irritable, sarcastic\r\n",
      "mood, changed the subject.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My affairs cannot possibly interest you,\" she said. \"Still, if you DO\r\n",
      "wish to know, I am in debt. I borrowed some money, and must pay it back\r\n",
      "again. I have a curious, senseless idea that I am bound to win at the\r\n",
      "gaming-tables. Why I think so I cannot tell, but I do think so, and\r\n",
      "with some assurance. Perhaps it is because of that assurance that I now\r\n",
      "find myself without any other resource.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Or perhaps it is because it is so NECESSARY for you to win. It is like\r\n",
      "a drowning man catching at a straw. You yourself will agree that,\r\n",
      "unless he were drowning he would not mistake a straw for the trunk of a\r\n",
      "tree.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Polina looked surprised.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What?\" she said. \"Do not you also hope something from it? Did you not\r\n",
      "tell me again and again, two weeks ago, that you were certain of\r\n",
      "winning at roulette if you played here? And did you not ask me not to\r\n",
      "consider you a fool for doing so? Were you joking? You cannot have\r\n",
      "been, for I remember that you spoke with a gravity which forbade the\r\n",
      "idea of your jesting.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"True,\" I replied gloomily. \"I always felt certain that I should win.\r\n",
      "Indeed, what you say makes me ask myself--Why have my absurd, senseless\r\n",
      "losses of today raised a doubt in my mind? Yet I am still positive\r\n",
      "that, so soon as ever I begin to play for myself, I shall infallibly\r\n",
      "win.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And why are you so certain?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"To tell the truth, I do not know. I only know that I must win--that it\r\n",
      "is the one resource I have left. Yes, why do I feel so assured on the\r\n",
      "point?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Perhaps because one cannot help winning if one is fanatically certain\r\n",
      "of doing so.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yet I dare wager that you do not think me capable of serious feeling\r\n",
      "in the matter?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I do not care whether you are so or not,\" answered Polina with calm\r\n",
      "indifference. \"Well, since you ask me, I DO doubt your ability to take\r\n",
      "anything seriously. You are capable of worrying, but not deeply. You\r\n",
      "are too ill-regulated and unsettled a person for that. But why do you\r\n",
      "want money? Not a single one of the reasons which you have given can be\r\n",
      "looked upon as serious.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"By the way,\" I interrupted, \"you say you want to pay off a debt. It\r\n",
      "must be a large one. Is it to the Frenchman?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What do you mean by asking all these questions? You are very clever\r\n",
      "today. Surely you are not drunk?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You know that you and I stand on no ceremony, and that sometimes I put\r\n",
      "to you very plain questions. I repeat that I am your slave--and slaves\r\n",
      "cannot be shamed or offended.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You talk like a child. It is always possible to comport oneself with\r\n",
      "dignity. If one has a quarrel it ought to elevate rather than to\r\n",
      "degrade one.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"A maxim straight from the copybook! Suppose I CANNOT comport myself\r\n",
      "with dignity. By that I mean that, though I am a man of self-respect, I\r\n",
      "am unable to carry off a situation properly. Do you know the reason? It\r\n",
      "is because we Russians are too richly and multifariously gifted to be\r\n",
      "able at once to find the proper mode of expression. It is all a\r\n",
      "question of mode. Most of us are so bounteously endowed with intellect\r\n",
      "as to require also a spice of genius to choose the right form of\r\n",
      "behaviour. And genius is lacking in us for the reason that so little\r\n",
      "genius at all exists. It belongs only to the French--though a few other\r\n",
      "Europeans have elaborated their forms so well as to be able to figure\r\n",
      "with extreme dignity, and yet be wholly undignified persons. That is\r\n",
      "why, with us, the mode is so all-important. The Frenchman may receive\r\n",
      "an insult--a real, a venomous insult: yet, he will not so much as\r\n",
      "frown. But a tweaking of the nose he cannot bear, for the reason that\r\n",
      "such an act is an infringement of the accepted, of the time-hallowed\r\n",
      "order of decorum. That is why our good ladies are so fond of\r\n",
      "Frenchmen--the Frenchman's manners, they say, are perfect! But in my\r\n",
      "opinion there is no such thing as a Frenchman's manners. The Frenchman\r\n",
      "is only a bird--the coq gaulois. At the same time, as I am not a woman,\r\n",
      "I do not properly understand the question. Cocks may be excellent\r\n",
      "birds.  If I am wrong you must stop me. You ought to stop and correct\r\n",
      "me more often when I am speaking to you, for I am too apt to say\r\n",
      "everything that is in my head.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You see, I have lost my manners. I agree that I have none, nor yet any\r\n",
      "dignity. I will tell you why. I set no store upon such things.\r\n",
      "Everything in me has undergone a cheek. You know the reason. I have not\r\n",
      "a single human thought in my head. For a long while I have been\r\n",
      "ignorant of what is going on in the world--here or in Russia. I have\r\n",
      "been to Dresden, yet am completely in the dark as to what Dresden is\r\n",
      "like. You know the cause of my obsession. I have no hope now, and am a\r\n",
      "mere cipher in your eyes; wherefore, I tell you outright that wherever\r\n",
      "I go I see only you--all the rest is a matter of indifference.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why or how I have come to love you I do not know. It may be that you\r\n",
      "are not altogether fair to look upon. Do you know, I am ignorant even\r\n",
      "as to what your face is like. In all probability, too, your heart is\r\n",
      "not comely, and it is possible that your mind is wholly ignoble.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And because you do not believe in my nobility of soul you think to\r\n",
      "purchase me with money?\" she said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"WHEN have I thought to do so?\" was my reply.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You are losing the thread of the argument. If you do not wish to\r\n",
      "purchase me, at all events you wish to purchase my respect.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Not at all. I have told you that I find it difficult to explain\r\n",
      "myself. You are hard upon me. Do not be angry at my chattering. You\r\n",
      "know why you ought not to be angry with me--that I am simply an\r\n",
      "imbecile. However, I do not mind if you ARE angry. Sitting in my room,\r\n",
      "I need but to think of you, to imagine to myself the rustle of your\r\n",
      "dress, and at once I fall almost to biting my hands. Why should you be\r\n",
      "angry with me? Because I call myself your slave? Revel, I pray you, in\r\n",
      "my slavery--revel in it. Do you know that sometimes I could kill\r\n",
      "you?--not because I do not love you, or am jealous of you, but, because\r\n",
      "I feel as though I could simply devour you... You are laughing!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No, I am not,\" she retorted. \"But I order you, nevertheless, to be\r\n",
      "silent.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She stopped, well nigh breathless with anger. God knows, she may not\r\n",
      "have been a beautiful woman, yet I loved to see her come to a halt like\r\n",
      "this, and was therefore, the more fond of arousing her temper. Perhaps\r\n",
      "she divined this, and for that very reason gave way to rage. I said as\r\n",
      "much to her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What rubbish!\" she cried with a shudder.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I do not care,\" I continued. \"Also, do you know that it is not safe\r\n",
      "for us to take walks together? Often I have a feeling that I should\r\n",
      "like to strike you, to disfigure you, to strangle you. Are you certain\r\n",
      "that it will never come to that? You are driving me to frenzy. Am I\r\n",

      "Why should I not become a fatalist? Remember how, on the third day that\r\n",
      "we ascended the Shlangenberg, I was moved to whisper in your ear: 'Say\r\n",
      "but the word, and I will leap into the abyss.' Had you said it, I\r\n",
      "should have leapt. Do you not believe me?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What stupid rubbish!\" she cried.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I care not whether it be wise or stupid,\" I cried in return. \"I only\r\n",
      "know that in your presence I must speak, speak, speak. Therefore, I am\r\n",
      "speaking. I lose all conceit when I am with you, and everything ceases\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Why should I have wanted you to leap from the Shlangenberg?\" she said\r\n",

      "barbarous, unlimited power--even if it be only over a fly--why, it is a\r\n",
      "kind of luxury. Man is a despot by nature, and loves to torture. You,\r\n",
      "in particular, love to do so.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I remember that at this moment she looked at me in a peculiar way. The\r\n",
      "fact is that my face must have been expressing all the maze of\r\n",
      "senseless, gross sensations which were seething within me. To this day\r\n",
      "I can remember, word for word, the conversation as I have written it\r\n",
      "down. My eyes were suffused with blood, and the foam had caked itself\r\n",
      "on my lips. Also, on my honour I swear that, had she bidden me cast\r\n",
      "myself from the summit of the Shlangenberg, I should have done it. Yes,\r\n",
      "had she bidden me in jest, or only in contempt and with a spit in my\r\n",
      "face, I should have cast myself down.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh no! Why so? I believe you,\" she said, but in such a manner--in the\r\n",
      "manner of which, at times, she was a mistress--and with such a note of\r\n",
      "disdain and viperish arrogance in her tone, that God knows I could have\r\n",
      "killed her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Yes, at that moment she stood in peril. I had not lied to her about\r\n",
      "that.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Surely you are not a coward?\" suddenly she asked me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I do not know,\" I replied. \"Perhaps I am, but I do not know. I have\r\n",
      "long given up thinking about such things.\"\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Do YOU, rather, tell me,\" I said, \"what is going on here? Why do you\r\n",

      "step-daughter of a ruined and insensate man who is smitten with love\r\n",
      "for this devil of a Blanche. And there is this Frenchman, too, with his\r\n",
      "mysterious influence over you. Yet, you actually ask me such a\r\n",
      "question! If you do not tell me how things stand, I shall have to put\r\n",
      "in my oar and do something. Are you ashamed to be frank with me? Are\r\n",
      "you shy of me?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I am not going to talk to you on that subject. I have asked you a\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, then--I will kill whomsoever you wish,\" I said. \"But are you\r\n",

      "over me, that she should assume such authority and say outright:\r\n",
      "\"Either you kill whom I bid you, or I will have nothing more to do with\r\n",
      "you.\" Indeed, in what she had said there was something so cynical and\r\n",
      "unveiled as to pass all bounds. For how could she ever regard me as the\r\n",
      "same after the killing was done? This was more than slavery and\r\n",
      "abasement; it was sufficient to bring a man back to his right senses.\r\n",
      "Yet, despite the outrageous improbability of our conversation, my heart\r\n",
      "shook within me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Suddenly, she burst out laughing. We were seated on a bench near the\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "tall, wizened Prussian there, with the stick in his hand. Do you\r\n",
      "remember how he stared at us the other day? Well, go to the Baroness,\r\n",
      "take off your hat to her, and say something in French.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Because you have sworn that you would leap from the Shlangenberg for\r\n",
      "my sake, and that you would kill any one whom I might bid you kill.\r\n",
      "Well, instead of such murders and tragedies, I wish only for a good\r\n",
      "laugh. Go without answering me, and let me see the Baron give you a\r\n",
      "sound thrashing with his stick.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "not be doing the General a great disservice, as well as, through him, a\r\n",
      "great disservice to yourself? It is not about myself I am worrying--it\r\n",
      "is about you and the General. Why, for a mere fancy, should I go and\r\n",
      "insult a woman?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah! Then I can see that you are only a trifler,\" she said\r\n",
      "contemptuously. \"Your eyes are swimming with blood--but only because\r\n",
      "you have drunk a little too much at luncheon. Do I not know that what I\r\n",
      "have asked you to do is foolish and wrong, and that the General will be\r\n",
      "angry about it? But I want to have a good laugh, all the same. I want\r\n",
      "that, and nothing else. Why should you insult a woman, indeed? Well,\r\n",
      "you will be given a sound thrashing for so doing.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I turned away, and went silently to do her bidding. Of course the thing\r\n",
      "was folly, but I could not get out of it. I remember that, as I\r\n",
      "approached the Baroness, I felt as excited as a schoolboy. I was in a\r\n",
      "frenzy, as though I were drunk.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "VI\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Two days have passed since that day of lunacy. What a noise and a fuss\r\n",
      "and a chattering and an uproar there was! And what a welter of\r\n",
      "unseemliness and disorder and stupidity and bad manners! And I the\r\n",
      "cause of it all! Yet part of the scene was also ridiculous--at all\r\n",
      "events to myself it was so. I am not quite sure what was the matter\r\n",
      "with me--whether I was merely stupefied or whether I purposely broke\r\n",
      "loose and ran amok. At times my mind seems all confused; while at other\r\n",
      "times I seem almost to be back in my childhood, at the school desk, and\r\n",
      "to have done the deed simply out of mischief.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It all came of Polina--yes, of Polina. But for her, there might never\r\n",
      "have been a fracas. Or perhaps I did the deed in a fit of despair\r\n",
      "(though it may be foolish of me to think so)? What there is so\r\n",
      "attractive about her I cannot think. Yet there IS something attractive\r\n",
      "about her--something passing fair, it would seem. Others besides myself\r\n",
      "she has driven to distraction. She is tall and straight, and very slim.\r\n",
      "Her body looks as though it could be tied into a knot, or bent double,\r\n",
      "like a cord. The imprint of her foot is long and narrow. It is, a\r\n",
      "maddening imprint--yes, simply a maddening one! And her hair has a\r\n",
      "reddish tint about it, and her eyes are like cat's eyes--though able\r\n",
      "also to glance with proud, disdainful mien. On the evening of my first\r\n",
      "arrival, four months ago, I remember that she was sitting and holding\r\n",
      "an animated conversation with De Griers in the salon. And the way in\r\n",
      "which she looked at him was such that later, when I retired to my own\r\n",
      "room upstairs, I kept fancying that she had smitten him in the\r\n",
      "face--that she had smitten him right on the cheek, so peculiar had been\r\n",
      "her look as she stood confronting him. Ever since that evening I have\r\n",
      "loved her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But to my tale.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I stepped from the path into the carriage-way, and took my stand in the\r\n",
      "middle of it. There I awaited the Baron and the Baroness. When they\r\n",
      "were but a few paces distant from me I took off my hat, and bowed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I remember that the Baroness was clad in a voluminous silk dress, pale\r\n",
      "grey in colour, and adorned with flounces and a crinoline and train.\r\n",
      "Also, she was short and inordinately stout, while her gross, flabby\r\n",
      "chin completely concealed her neck. Her face was purple, and the little\r\n",
      "eyes in it had an impudent, malicious expression. Yet she walked as\r\n",
      "though she were conferring a favour upon everybody by so doing. As for\r\n",
      "the Baron, he was tall, wizened, bony-faced after the German fashion,\r\n",
      "spectacled, and, apparently, about forty-five years of age. Also, he\r\n",
      "had legs which seemed to begin almost at his chest--or, rather, at his\r\n",
      "chin! Yet, for all his air of peacock-like conceit, his clothes sagged\r\n",
      "a little, and his face wore a sheepish air which might have passed for\r\n",
      "profundity.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "These details I noted within a space of a few seconds.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At first my bow and the fact that I had my hat in my hand barely caught\r\n",
      "their attention. The Baron only scowled a little, and the Baroness\r\n",
      "swept straight on.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Madame la Baronne,\" said I, loudly and distinctly--embroidering each\r\n",
      "word, as it were--\"j'ai l'honneur d'etre votre esclave.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then I bowed again, put on my hat, and walked past the Baron with a\r\n",
      "rude smile on my face.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Polina had ordered me merely to take off my hat: the bow and the\r\n",
      "general effrontery were of my own invention. God knows what instigated\r\n",
      "me to perpetrate the outrage! In my frenzy I felt as though I were\r\n",
      "walking on air.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Hein!\" ejaculated--or, rather, growled--the Baron as he turned towards\r\n",
      "me in angry surprise.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I too turned round, and stood waiting in pseudo-courteous expectation.\r\n",
      "Yet still I wore on my face an impudent smile as I gazed at him. He\r\n",
      "seemed to hesitate, and his brows contracted to their utmost limits.\r\n",
      "Every moment his visage was growing darker. The Baroness also turned in\r\n",
      "my direction, and gazed at me in wrathful perplexity, while some of the\r\n",
      "passers-by also began to stare at us, and others of them halted\r\n",
      "outright.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Hein!\" the Baron vociferated again, with a redoubled growl and a note\r\n",
      "of growing wrath in his voice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ja wohl!\" I replied, still looking him in the eyes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Sind sie rasend?\" he exclaimed, brandishing his stick, and,\r\n",
      "apparently, beginning to feel nervous. Perhaps it was my costume which\r\n",
      "intimidated him, for I was well and fashionably dressed, after the\r\n",
      "manner of a man who belongs to indisputably good society.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ja wo-o-ohl!\" cried I again with all my might with a longdrawn rolling\r\n",
      "of the \"ohl\" sound after the fashion of the Berliners (who constantly\r\n",
      "use the phrase \"Ja wohl!\" in conversation, and more or less prolong the\r\n",
      "syllable \"ohl\" according as they desire to express different shades of\r\n",
      "meaning or of mood).\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At this the Baron and the Baroness faced sharply about, and almost fled\r\n",
      "in their alarm. Some of the bystanders gave vent to excited\r\n",
      "exclamations, and others remained staring at me in astonishment. But I\r\n",
      "do not remember the details very well.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Wheeling quietly about, I returned in the direction of Polina\r\n",
      "Alexandrovna. But, when I had got within a hundred paces of her seat, I\r\n",
      "saw her rise and set out with the children towards the hotel.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At the portico I caught up to her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I have perpetrated the--the piece of idiocy,\" I said as I came level\r\n",
      "with her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Have you? Then you can take the consequences,\" she replied without so\r\n",
      "much as looking at me. Then she moved towards the staircase.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I spent the rest of the evening walking in the park. Thence I passed\r\n",
      "into the forest, and walked on until I found myself in a neighbouring\r\n",
      "principality. At a wayside restaurant I partook of an omelette and some\r\n",
      "wine, and was charged for the idyllic repast a thaler and a half.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Not until eleven o'clock did I return home--to find a summons awaiting\r\n",
      "me from the General.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Our party occupied two suites in the hotel; each of which contained two\r\n",
      "rooms. The first (the larger suite) comprised a salon and a\r\n",
      "smoking-room, with, adjoining the latter, the General's study. It was\r\n",
      "here that he was awaiting me as he stood posed in a majestic attitude\r\n",
      "beside his writing-table. Lolling on a divan close by was De Griers.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My good sir,\" the General began, \"may I ask you what this is that you\r\n",
      "have gone and done?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I should be glad,\" I replied, \"if we could come straight to the point.\r\n",
      "Probably you are referring to my encounter of today with a German?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"With a German? Why, the German was the Baron Burmergelm--a most\r\n",
      "important personage! I hear that you have been rude both to him and to\r\n",
      "the Baroness?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No, I have not.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But I understand that you simply terrified them, my good sir?\" shouted\r\n",
      "the General.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Not in the least,\" I replied. \"You must know that when I was in Berlin\r\n",
      "I frequently used to hear the Berliners repeat, and repellently\r\n",
      "prolong, a certain phrase--namely, 'Ja wohl!'; and, happening to meet\r\n",
      "this couple in the carriage-drive, I found, for some reason or another,\r\n",
      "that this phrase suddenly recurred to my memory, and exercised a\r\n",
      "rousing effect upon my spirits. Moreover, on the three previous\r\n",
      "occasions that I have met the Baroness she has walked towards me as\r\n",
      "though I were a worm which could easily be crushed with the foot. Not\r\n",
      "unnaturally, I too possess a measure of self-respect; wherefore, on\r\n",
      "THIS occasion I took off my hat, and said politely (yes, I assure you\r\n",
      "it was said politely): 'Madame, j'ai l'honneur d'etre votre esclave.'\r\n",
      "Then the Baron turned round, and said 'Hein!'; whereupon I felt moved\r\n",
      "to ejaculate in answer 'Ja wohl!' Twice I shouted it at him--the first\r\n",
      "time in an ordinary tone, and the second time with the greatest\r\n",
      "prolonging of the words of which I was capable. That is all.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I must confess that this puerile explanation gave me great pleasure. I\r\n",
      "felt a strong desire to overlay the incident with an even added measure\r\n",
      "of grossness; so, the further I proceeded, the more did the gusto of my\r\n",
      "proceeding increase.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You are only making fun of me!\" vociferated the General as, turning to\r\n",
      "the Frenchman, he declared that my bringing about of the incident had\r\n",
      "been gratuitous. De Griers smiled contemptuously, and shrugged his\r\n",
      "shoulders.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do not think THAT,\" I put in. \"It was not so at all. I grant you that\r\n",
      "my behaviour was bad--I fully confess that it was so, and make no\r\n",
      "secret of the fact. I would even go so far as to grant you that my\r\n",
      "behaviour might well be called stupid and indecent tomfoolery; but,\r\n",
      "MORE than that it was not. Also, let me tell you that I am very sorry\r\n",
      "for my conduct. Yet there is one circumstance which, in my eyes, almost\r\n",
      "absolves me from regret in the matter. Of late--that is to say, for the\r\n",
      "last two or three weeks--I have been feeling not at all well. That is\r\n",
      "to say, I have been in a sick, nervous, irritable, fanciful condition,\r\n",
      "so that I have periodically lost control over myself. For instance, on\r\n",
      "more than one occasion I have tried to pick a quarrel even with\r\n",
      "Monsieur le Marquise here; and, under the circumstances, he had no\r\n",
      "choice but to answer me. In short, I have recently been showing signs\r\n",
      "of ill-health. Whether the Baroness Burmergelm will take this\r\n",
      "circumstance into consideration when I come to beg her pardon (for I do\r\n",
      "intend to make her amends) I do not know; but I doubt if she will, and\r\n",
      "the less so since, so far as I know, the circumstance is one which, of\r\n",
      "late, has begun to be abused in the legal world, in that advocates in\r\n",
      "criminal cases have taken to justifying their clients on the ground\r\n",
      "that, at the moment of the crime, they (the clients) were unconscious\r\n",
      "of what they were doing--that, in short, they were out of health. 'My\r\n",
      "client committed the murder--that is true; but he has no recollection\r\n",
      "of having committed it.' And doctors actually support these advocates\r\n",
      "by affirming that there really is such a malady--that there really can\r\n",
      "arise temporary delusions which make a man remember nothing of a given\r\n",
      "deed, or only a half or a quarter of it! But the Baron and Baroness are\r\n",

      "landowners. To them such a process in the medico-judicial world will be\r\n",
      "unknown, and therefore, they are the more unlikely to accept any such\r\n",
      "explanation. What is YOUR opinion about it, General?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Enough, sir!\" he thundered with barely restrained fury. \"Enough, I\r\n",
      "say! Once and for all I must endeavour to rid myself of you and your\r\n",
      "impertinence. To justify yourself in the eyes of the Baron and Baroness\r\n",
      "will be impossible. Any intercourse with you, even though it be\r\n",
      "confined to a begging of their pardons, they would look upon as a\r\n",
      "degradation. I may tell you that, on learning that you formed part of,\r\n",
      "my household, the Baron approached me in the Casino, and demanded of me\r\n",
      "additional satisfaction. Do you understand, then, what it is that you\r\n",
      "have entailed upon me--upon ME, my good sir? You have entailed upon me\r\n",
      "the fact of my being forced to sue humbly to the Baron, and to give him\r\n",
      "my word of honour that this very day you shall cease to belong to my\r\n",
      "establishment!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Excuse me, General,\" I interrupted, \"but did he make an express point\r\n",
      "of it that I should 'cease to belong to your establishment,' as you\r\n",
      "call it?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No; I, of my own initiative, thought that I ought to afford him that\r\n",
      "satisfaction; and, with it he was satisfied. So we must part, good sir.\r\n",
      "It is my duty to hand over to you forty gulden, three florins, as per\r\n",
      "the accompanying statement. Here is the money, and here the account,\r\n",
      "which you are at liberty to verify. Farewell. From henceforth we are\r\n",
      "strangers. From you I have never had anything but trouble and\r\n",
      "unpleasantness. I am about to call the landlord, and explain to him\r\n",

      "hotel expenses. Also I have the honour to remain your obedient servant.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "me) is your own. How came you to answer for me to the Baron? And what\r\n",
      "did you mean by saying that I formed part of your household? I am\r\n",
      "merely your family tutor--not a son of yours, nor yet your ward, nor a\r\n",
      "person of any kind for whose acts you need be responsible. I am a\r\n",
      "judicially competent person, a man of twenty-five years of age, a\r\n",
      "university graduate, a gentleman, and, until I met yourself, a complete\r\n",
      "stranger to you. Only my boundless respect for your merits restrains me\r\n",
      "from demanding satisfaction at your hands, as well as a further\r\n",
      "explanation as to the reasons which have led you to take it upon\r\n",
      "yourself to answer for my conduct.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So struck was he with my words that, spreading out his hands, he turned\r\n",
      "to the Frenchman, and interpreted to him that I had challenged himself\r\n",
      "(the General) to a duel. The Frenchman laughed aloud.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Nor do I intend to let the Baron off,\" I continued calmly, but with\r\n",
      "not a little discomfiture at De Griers' merriment. \"And since you,\r\n",
      "General, have today been so good as to listen to the Baron's\r\n",
      "complaints, and to enter into his concerns--since you have made\r\n",
      "yourself a participator in the affair--I have the honour to inform you\r\n",
      "that, tomorrow morning at the latest, I shall, in my own name, demand\r\n",
      "of the said Baron a formal explanation as to the reasons which have led\r\n",
      "him to disregard the fact that the matter lies between him and myself\r\n",
      "alone, and to put a slight upon me by referring it to another person,\r\n",
      "as though I were unworthy to answer for my own conduct.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then there happened what I had foreseen. The General on hearing of this\r\n",
      "further intended outrage, showed the white feather.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What?\" he cried. \"Do you intend to go on with this damned nonsense? Do\r\n",
      "you not realise the harm that it is doing me? I beg of you not to laugh\r\n",
      "at me, sir--not to laugh at me, for we have police authorities here\r\n",
      "who, out of respect for my rank, and for that of the Baron...  In\r\n",
      "short, sir, I swear to you that I will have you arrested, and marched\r\n",
      "out of the place, to prevent any further brawling on your part. Do you\r\n",
      "understand what I say?\" He was almost breathless with anger, as well as\r\n",
      "in a terrible fright.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"General,\" I replied with that calmness which he never could abide,\r\n",
      "\"one cannot arrest a man for brawling until he has brawled. I have not\r\n",
      "so much as begun my explanations to the Baron, and you are altogether\r\n",
      "ignorant as to the form and time which my intended procedure is likely\r\n",
      "to assume. I wish but to disabuse the Baron of what is, to me, a\r\n",
      "shameful supposition--namely, that I am under the guardianship of a\r\n",
      "person who is qualified to exercise control over my free will. It is\r\n",
      "vain for you to disturb and alarm yourself.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"For God's sake, Alexis Ivanovitch, do put an end to this senseless\r\n",
      "scheme of yours!\" he muttered, but with a sudden change from a\r\n",
      "truculent tone to one of entreaty as he caught me by the hand. \"Do you\r\n",
      "know what is likely to come of it? Merely further unpleasantness. You\r\n",
      "will agree with me, I am sure, that at present I ought to move with\r\n",
      "especial care--yes, with very especial care. You cannot be fully aware\r\n",
      "of how I am situated. When we leave this place I shall be ready to\r\n",
      "receive you back into my household; but, for the time being I-- Well, I\r\n",
      "cannot tell you all my reasons.\" With that he wound up in a despairing\r\n",
      "voice: \"O Alexis Ivanovitch, Alexis Ivanovitch!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I moved towards the door--begging him to be calm, and promising that\r\n",
      "everything should be done decently and in order; whereafter I departed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Russians, when abroad, are over-apt to play the poltroon, to watch all\r\n",
      "their words, and to wonder what people are thinking of their conduct,\r\n",
      "or whether such and such a thing is 'comme il faut.' In short, they are\r\n",
      "over-apt to cosset themselves, and to lay claim to great importance.\r\n",
      "Always they prefer the form of behaviour which has once and for all\r\n",
      "become accepted and established. This they will follow slavishly\r\n",
      "whether in hotels, on promenades, at meetings, or when on a journey.\r\n",
      "But the General had avowed to me that, over and above such\r\n",
      "considerations as these, there were circumstances which compelled him\r\n",
      "to \"move with especial care at present\", and that the fact had actually\r\n",
      "made him poor-spirited and a coward--it had made him altogether change\r\n",
      "his tone towards me. This fact I took into my calculations, and duly\r\n",
      "noted it, for, of course, he MIGHT apply to the authorities tomorrow,\r\n",
      "and it behoved me to go carefully.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Yet it was not the General but Polina that I wanted to anger. She had\r\n",
      "treated me with such cruelty, and had got me into such a hole, that I\r\n",
      "felt a longing to force her to beseech me to stop. Of course, my\r\n",
      "tomfoolery might compromise her; yet certain other feelings and desires\r\n",
      "had begun to form themselves in my brain. If I was never to rank in her\r\n",
      "eyes as anything but a nonentity, it would not greatly matter if I\r\n",
      "figured as a draggle-tailed cockerel, and the Baron were to give me a\r\n",
      "good thrashing; but, the fact was that I desired to have the laugh of\r\n",
      "them all, and to come out myself unscathed. Let people see what they\r\n",
      "WOULD see. Let Polina, for once, have a good fright, and be forced to\r\n",
      "whistle me to heel again. But, however much she might whistle, she\r\n",
      "should see that I was at least no draggle-tailed cockerel!\r\n",

      "Philipovna departed today, by the night train, to stay with a cousin at\r\n",
      "Carlsbad. What can that mean? The maid declares that Madame packed her\r\n",

      "been aware of the circumstance? Or is it that I have been the only\r\n",
      "person to be unaware of it? Also, the maid has just told me that, three\r\n",
      "days ago, Maria Philipovna had some high words with the General. I\r\n",

      "VII\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the morning I sent for the maitre d'hotel, and explained to him\r\n",
      "that, in future, my bill was to be rendered to me personally. As a\r\n",
      "matter of fact, my expenses had never been so large as to alarm me, nor\r\n",
      "to lead me to quit the hotel; while, moreover, I still had 160 gulden\r\n",
      "left to me, and--in them--yes, in them, perhaps, riches awaited me. It\r\n",
      "was a curious fact, that, though I had not yet won anything at play, I\r\n",
      "nevertheless acted, thought, and felt as though I were sure, before\r\n",
      "long, to become wealthy--since I could not imagine myself otherwise.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Next, I bethought me, despite the earliness of the hour, of going to\r\n",
      "see Mr. Astley, who was staying at the Hotel de l'Angleterre (a\r\n",
      "hostelry at no great distance from our own). But suddenly De Griers\r\n",
      "entered my room. This had never before happened, for of late that\r\n",
      "gentleman and I had stood on the most strained and distant of terms--he\r\n",
      "attempting no concealment of his contempt for me (he even made an\r\n",
      "express, point of showing it), and I having no reason to desire his\r\n",
      "company. In short, I detested him. Consequently, his entry at the\r\n",
      "present moment the more astounded me. At once I divined that something\r\n",
      "out of the way was on the carpet.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He entered with marked affability, and began by complimenting me on my\r\n",
      "room. Then, perceiving that I had my hat in my hands, he inquired\r\n",
      "whither I was going so early; and, no sooner did he hear that I was\r\n",
      "bound for Mr. Astley's than he stopped, looked grave, and seemed\r\n",
      "plunged in thought.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was a true Frenchman insofar as that, though he could be lively and\r\n",
      "engaging when it suited him, he became insufferably dull and wearisome\r\n",
      "as soon as ever the need for being lively and engaging had passed.\r\n",
      "Seldom is a Frenchman NATURALLY civil: he is civil only as though to\r\n",
      "order and of set purpose. Also, if he thinks it incumbent upon him to\r\n",
      "be fanciful, original, and out of the way, his fancy always assumes a\r\n",
      "foolish, unnatural vein, for the reason that it is compounded of trite,\r\n",
      "hackneyed forms. In short, the natural Frenchman is a conglomeration of\r\n",
      "commonplace, petty, everyday positiveness, so that he is the most\r\n",
      "tedious person in the world.--Indeed, I believe that none but\r\n",
      "greenhorns and excessively Russian people feel an attraction towards\r\n",
      "the French; for, to any man of sensibility, such a compendium of\r\n",
      "outworn forms--a compendium which is built up of drawing-room manners,\r\n",
      "expansiveness, and gaiety--becomes at once over-noticeable and\r\n",
      "unbearable.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I have come to see you on business,\" De Griers began in a very\r\n",
      "off-hand, yet polite, tone; \"nor will I seek to conceal from you the\r\n",
      "fact that I have come in the capacity of an emissary, of an\r\n",
      "intermediary, from the General. Having small knowledge of the Russian\r\n",
      "tongue, I lost most of what was said last night; but, the General has\r\n",
      "now explained matters, and I must confess that--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"See here, Monsieur de Griers,\" I interrupted. \"I understand that you\r\n",
      "have undertaken to act in this affair as an intermediary. Of course I\r\n",
      "am only 'un utchitel,' a tutor, and have never claimed to be an\r\n",
      "intimate of this household, nor to stand on at all familiar terms with\r\n",
      "it. Consequently, I do not know the whole of its circumstances. Yet\r\n",
      "pray explain to me this: have you yourself become one of its members,\r\n",
      "seeing that you are beginning to take such a part in everything, and\r\n",
      "are now present as an intermediary?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Frenchman seemed not over-pleased at my question. It was one which\r\n",
      "was too outspoken for his taste--and he had no mind to be frank with me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I am connected with the General,\" he said drily, \"partly through\r\n",
      "business affairs, and partly through special circumstances. My\r\n",
      "principal has sent me merely to ask you to forego your intentions of\r\n",
      "last evening. What you contemplate is, I have no doubt, very clever;\r\n",
      "yet he has charged me to represent to you that you have not the\r\n",
      "slightest chance of succeeding in your end, since not only will the\r\n",
      "Baron refuse to receive you, but also he (the Baron) has at his\r\n",
      "disposal every possible means for obviating further unpleasantness from\r\n",
      "you. Surely you can see that yourself? What, then, would be the good of\r\n",
      "going on with it all? On the other hand, the General promises that at\r\n",
      "the first favourable opportunity he will receive you back into his\r\n",
      "household, and, in the meantime, will credit you with your salary--with\r\n",
      "'vos appointements.' Surely that will suit you, will it not?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Very quietly I replied that he (the Frenchman) was labouring under a\r\n",
      "delusion; that perhaps, after all, I should not be expelled from the\r\n",
      "Baron's presence, but, on the contrary, be listened to; finally, that I\r\n",
      "should be glad if Monsieur de Griers would confess that he was now\r\n",
      "visiting me merely in order to see how far I intended to go in the\r\n",
      "affair.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Good heavens!\" cried de Griers. \"Seeing that the General takes such an\r\n",
      "interest in the matter, is there anything very unnatural in his\r\n",
      "desiring also to know your plans?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Again I began my explanations, but the Frenchman only fidgeted and\r\n",
      "rolled his head about as he listened with an expression of manifest and\r\n",
      "unconcealed irony on his face. In short, he adopted a supercilious\r\n",
      "attitude. For my own part, I endeavoured to pretend that I took the\r\n",
      "affair very seriously. I declared that, since the Baron had gone and\r\n",
      "complained of me to the General, as though I were a mere servant of the\r\n",
      "General's, he had, in the first place, lost me my post, and, in the\r\n",
      "second place, treated me like a person to whom, as to one not qualified\r\n",
      "to answer for himself, it was not even worth while to speak. Naturally,\r\n",
      "I said, I felt insulted at this. Yet, comprehending as I did,\r\n",
      "differences of years, of social status, and so forth (here I could\r\n",
      "scarcely help smiling), I was not anxious to bring about further scenes\r\n",
      "by going personally to demand or to request satisfaction of the Baron.\r\n",
      "All that I felt was that I had a right to go in person and beg the\r\n",
      "Baron's and the Baroness's pardon--the more so since, of late, I had\r\n",
      "been feeling unwell and unstrung, and had been in a fanciful condition.\r\n",
      "And so forth, and so forth. Yet (I continued) the Baron's offensive\r\n",
      "behaviour to me of yesterday (that is to say, the fact of his referring\r\n",
      "the matter to the General) as well as his insistence that the General\r\n",
      "should deprive me of my post, had placed me in such a position that I\r\n",
      "could not well express my regret to him (the Baron) and to his good\r\n",
      "lady, for the reason that in all probability both he and the Baroness,\r\n",
      "with the world at large, would imagine that I was doing so merely\r\n",
      "because I hoped, by my action, to recover my post. Hence, I found\r\n",
      "myself forced to request the Baron to express to me HIS OWN regrets, as\r\n",
      "well as to express them in the most unqualified manner--to say, in\r\n",
      "fact, that he had never had any wish to insult me. After the Baron had\r\n",
      "done THAT, I should, for my part, at once feel free to express to him,\r\n",
      "whole-heartedly and without reserve, my own regrets. \"In short,\" I\r\n",
      "declared in conclusion, \"my one desire is that the Baron may make it\r\n",
      "possible for me to adopt the latter course.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh fie! What refinements and subtleties!\" exclaimed De Griers.\r\n",
      "\"Besides, what have you to express regret for? Confess, Monsieur,\r\n",
      "Monsieur--pardon me, but I have forgotten your name--confess, I say,\r\n",
      "that all this is merely a plan to annoy the General? Or perhaps, you\r\n",
      "have some other and special end in view? Eh?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"In return you must pardon ME, mon cher Marquis, and tell me what you\r\n",
      "have to do with it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The General--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But what of the General? Last night he said that, for some reason or\r\n",
      "another, it behoved him to 'move with especial care at present;'\r\n",
      "wherefore, he was feeling nervous. But I did not understand the\r\n",
      "reference.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, there DO exist special reasons for his doing so,\" assented De\r\n",
      "Griers in a conciliatory tone, yet with rising anger. \"You are\r\n",
      "acquainted with Mlle. de Cominges, are you not?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Mlle. Blanche, you mean?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, Mlle. Blanche de Cominges. Doubtless you know also that the\r\n",
      "General is in love with this young lady, and may even be about to marry\r\n",
      "her before he leaves here? Imagine, therefore, what any scene or\r\n",
      "scandal would entail upon him!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I cannot see that the marriage scheme need, be affected by scenes or\r\n",

      "Enfin il fera une querelle d'Allemand.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I do not care,\" I replied, \"seeing that I no longer belong to his\r\n",
      "household\" (of set purpose I was trying to talk as senselessly as\r\n",
      "possible). \"But is it quite settled that Mlle. is to marry the General?\r\n",
      "What are they waiting for? Why should they conceal such a matter--at\r\n",
      "all events from ourselves, the General's own party?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I cannot tell you. The marriage is not yet a settled affair, for they\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"To cut things short,\" he interrupted, \"I have complete confidence in\r\n",
      "your native politeness, as well as in your tact and good sense. I feel\r\n",
      "sure that you will do what I suggest, even if it is only for the sake\r\n",
      "of this family which has received you as a kinsman into its bosom and\r\n",
      "has always loved and respected you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Be so good as to observe,\" I remarked, \"that the same family has just\r\n",
      "EXPELLED me from its bosom. All that you are saying you are saying but\r\n",
      "for show; but, when people have just said to you, 'Of course we do not\r\n",
      "wish to turn you out, yet, for the sake of appearance's, you must\r\n",
      "PERMIT yourself to be turned out,' nothing can matter very much.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Very well, then,\" he said, in a sterner and more arrogant tone.\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "I reached for my hat; whereupon he nodded, and went out. Yet on his\r\n",

      "and, a couple of minutes later, my brain had sufficiently cleared to\r\n",
      "enable two ideas in particular to stand out in it. Firstly, I asked\r\n",
      "myself, which of the absurd, boyish, and extravagant threats which I\r\n",
      "had uttered at random last night had made everybody so alarmed?\r\n",
      "Secondly, what was the influence which this Frenchman appeared to\r\n",
      "exercise over Polina? He had but to give the word, and at once she did\r\n",
      "as he desired--at once she wrote me a note to beg of me to forbear! Of\r\n",
      "course, the relations between the pair had, from the first, been a\r\n",
      "riddle to me--they had been so ever since I had first made their\r\n",
      "acquaintance.  But of late I had remarked in her a strong aversion for,\r\n",
      "even a contempt for--him, while, for his part, he had scarcely even\r\n",
      "looked at her, but had behaved towards her always in the most churlish\r\n",
      "fashion. Yes, I had noted that. Also, Polina herself had mentioned to\r\n",
      "me her dislike for him, and delivered herself of some remarkable\r\n",
      "confessions on the subject. Hence, he must have got her into his power\r\n",
      "somehow--somehow he must be holding her as in a vice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "VIII\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "All at once, on the Promenade, as it was called--that is to say, in the\r\n",
      "Chestnut Avenue--I came face to face with my Englishman.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I was just coming to see you,\" he said; \"and you appear to be out on a\r\n",
      "similar errand. So you have parted with your employers?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"How do you know that?\" I asked in astonishment. \"Is EVERY ONE aware of\r\n",
      "the fact?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"By no means. Not every one would consider such a fact to be of moment.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Then how come you to know it?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Because I have had occasion to do so. Whither are you bound? I like\r\n",
      "you, and was therefore coming to pay you a visit.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What a splendid fellow you are, Mr. Astley!\" I cried, though still\r\n",
      "wondering how he had come by his knowledge. \"And since I have not yet\r\n",
      "had my coffee, and you have, in all probability, scarcely tasted yours,\r\n",
      "let us adjourn to the Casino Cafe, where we can sit and smoke and have\r\n",
      "a talk.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The cafe in question was only a hundred paces away; so, when coffee had\r\n",
      "been brought, we seated ourselves, and I lit a cigarette. Astley was no\r\n",
      "smoker, but, taking a seat by my side, he prepared himself to listen.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I do not intend to go away,\" was my first remark. \"I intend, on the\r\n",
      "contrary, to remain here.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That I never doubted,\" he answered good-humouredly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It is a curious fact that, on my way to see him, I had never even\r\n",
      "thought of telling him of my love for Polina. In fact, I had purposely\r\n",
      "meant to avoid any mention of the subject. Nor, during our stay in the\r\n",
      "place, had I ever made aught but the scantiest reference to it. You\r\n",
      "see, not only was Astley a man of great reserve, but also from the\r\n",
      "first I had perceived that Polina had made a great impression upon him,\r\n",
      "although he never spoke of her. But now, strangely enough, he had no\r\n",
      "sooner seated himself and bent his steely gaze upon me, than, for some\r\n",
      "reason or another, I felt moved to tell him everything--to speak to him\r\n",
      "of my love in all its phases. For an hour and a half did I discourse on\r\n",
      "the subject, and found it a pleasure to do so, even though this was the\r\n",
      "first occasion on which I had referred to the matter. Indeed, when, at\r\n",
      "certain moments, I perceived that my more ardent passages confused him,\r\n",
      "I purposely increased my ardour of narration. Yet one thing I regret:\r\n",
      "and that is that I made references to the Frenchman which were a little\r\n",
      "over-personal.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Astley sat without moving as he listened to me. Not a word nor a\r\n",
      "sound of any kind did he utter as he stared into my eyes. Suddenly,\r\n",
      "however, on my mentioning the Frenchman, he interrupted me, and\r\n",
      "inquired sternly whether I did right to speak of an extraneous matter\r\n",
      "(he had always been a strange man in his mode of propounding questions).\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No, I fear not,\" I replied.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And concerning this Marquis and Mlle. Polina you know nothing beyond\r\n",
      "surmise?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Again I was surprised that such a categorical question should come from\r\n",
      "such a reserved individual.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No, I know nothing FOR CERTAIN about them\" was my reply. \"No--nothing.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then you have done very wrong to speak of them to me, or even to\r\n",
      "imagine things about them.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Quite so, quite so,\" I interrupted in some astonishment. \"I admit\r\n",
      "that. Yet that is not the question.\" Whereupon I related to him in\r\n",
      "detail the incident of two days ago. I spoke of Polina's outburst, of\r\n",
      "my encounter with the Baron, of my dismissal, of the General's\r\n",
      "extraordinary pusillanimity, and of the call which De Griers had that\r\n",
      "morning paid me. In conclusion, I showed Astley the note which I had\r\n",
      "lately received.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What do you make of it?\" I asked. \"When I met you I was just coming to\r\n",
      "ask you your opinion. For myself, I could have killed this Frenchman,\r\n",
      "and am not sure that I shall not do so even yet.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I feel the same about it,\" said Mr. Astley. \"As for Mlle.\r\n",
      "Polina--well, you yourself know that, if necessity drives, one enters\r\n",
      "into relation with people whom one simply detests. Even between this\r\n",
      "couple there may be something which, though unknown to you, depends\r\n",
      "upon extraneous circumstances. For, my own part, I think that you may\r\n",
      "reassure yourself--or at all events partially. And as for Mlle.\r\n",
      "Polina's proceedings of two days ago, they were, of course, strange;\r\n",
      "not because she can have meant to get rid of you, or to earn for you a\r\n",
      "thrashing from the Baron's cudgel (which for some curious reason, he\r\n",
      "did not use, although he had it ready in his hands), but because such\r\n",
      "proceedings on the part of such--well, of such a refined lady as Mlle.\r\n",
      "Polina are, to say the least of it, unbecoming. But she cannot have\r\n",
      "guessed that you would carry out her absurd wish to the letter?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do you know what?\" suddenly I cried as I fixed Mr. Astley with my\r\n",
      "gaze. \"I believe that you have already heard the story from some\r\n",
      "one--very possibly from Mlle. Polina herself?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In return he gave me an astonished stare.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Your eyes look very fiery,\" he said with a return of his former calm,\r\n",
      "\"and in them I can read suspicion. Now, you have no right whatever to\r\n",
      "be suspicious. It is not a right which I can for a moment recognise,\r\n",
      "and I absolutely refuse to answer your questions.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Enough! You need say no more,\" I cried with a strange emotion at my\r\n",
      "heart, yet not altogether understanding what had aroused that emotion\r\n",
      "in my breast. Indeed, when, where, and how could Polina have chosen\r\n",
      "Astley to be one of her confidants? Of late I had come rather to\r\n",
      "overlook him in this connection, even though Polina had always been a\r\n",
      "riddle to me--so much so that now, when I had just permitted myself to\r\n",
      "tell my friend of my infatuation in all its aspects, I had found myself\r\n",
      "struck, during the very telling, with the fact that in my relations\r\n",
      "with her I could specify nothing that was explicit, nothing that was\r\n",
      "positive. On the contrary, my relations had been purely fantastic,\r\n",
      "strange, and unreal; they had been unlike anything else that I could\r\n",
      "think of.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Very well, very well,\" I replied with a warmth equal to Astley's own.\r\n",
      "\"Then I stand confounded, and have no further opinions to offer. But\r\n",
      "you are a good fellow, and I am glad to know what you think about it\r\n",
      "all, even though I do not need your advice.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then, after a pause, I resumed:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"For instance, what reason should you assign for the General taking\r\n",
      "fright in this way? Why should my stupid clowning have led the world to\r\n",
      "elevate it into a serious incident? Even De Griers has found it\r\n",
      "necessary to put in his oar (and he only interferes on the most\r\n",
      "important occasions), and to visit me, and to address to me the most\r\n",
      "earnest supplications. Yes, HE, De Griers, has actually been playing\r\n",
      "the suppliant to ME! And, mark you, although he came to me as early as\r\n",
      "nine o'clock, he had ready-prepared in his hand Mlle. Polina's note.\r\n",
      "When, I would ask, was that note written? Mlle. Polina must have been\r\n",
      "aroused from sleep for the express purpose of writing it. At all events\r\n",
      "the circumstance shows that she is an absolute slave to the Frenchman,\r\n",
      "since she actually begs my pardon in the note--actually begs my pardon!\r\n",
      "Yet what is her personal concern in the matter? Why is she interested\r\n",
      "in it at all? Why, too, is the whole party so afraid of this precious\r\n",
      "Baron? And what sort of a business do you call it for the General to be\r\n",
      "going to marry Mlle. Blanche de Cominges? He told me last night that,\r\n",
      "because of the circumstance, he must 'move with especial care at\r\n",
      "present.' What is your opinion of it all? Your look convinces me that\r\n",
      "you know more about it than I do.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Astley smiled and nodded.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, I think I DO know more about it than you do,\" he assented. \"The\r\n",
      "affair centres around this Mlle. Blanche. Of that I feel certain.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And what of Mlle. Blanche?\" I cried impatiently (for in me there had\r\n",
      "dawned a sudden hope that this would enable me to discover something\r\n",
      "about Polina).\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, my belief is that at the present moment Mlle. Blanche has, in\r\n",
      "very truth, a special reason for wishing to avoid any trouble with the\r\n",
      "Baron and the Baroness.  It might lead not only to some unpleasantness,\r\n",
      "but even to a scandal.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, oh!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Also I may tell you that Mlle. Blanche has been in Roulettenberg\r\n",
      "before, for she was staying here three seasons ago. I myself was in the\r\n",
      "place at the time, and in those days Mlle. Blanche was not known as\r\n",
      "Mlle. de Cominges, nor was her mother, the Widow de Cominges, even in\r\n",
      "existence. In any case no one ever mentioned the latter. De Griers,\r\n",
      "too, had not materialised, and I am convinced that not only do the\r\n",
      "parties stand in no relation to one another, but also they have not\r\n",
      "long enjoyed one another's acquaintance. Likewise, the Marquisate de\r\n",
      "Griers is of recent creation. Of that I have reason to be sure, owing\r\n",
      "to a certain circumstance. Even the name De Griers itself may be taken\r\n",
      "to be a new invention, seeing that I have a friend who once met the\r\n",
      "said 'Marquis' under a different name altogether.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yet he possesses a good circle of friends?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Possibly. Mlle. Blanche also may possess that. Yet it is not three\r\n",
      "years since she received from the local police, at the instance of the\r\n",
      "Baroness, an invitation to leave the town. And she left it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But why?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, I must tell you that she first appeared here in company with an\r\n",
      "Italian--a prince of some sort, a man who bore an historic name\r\n",
      "(Barberini or something of the kind). The fellow was simply a mass of\r\n",
      "rings and diamonds--real diamonds, too--and the couple used to drive\r\n",
      "out in a marvellous carriage. At first Mlle. Blanche played 'trente et\r\n",
      "quarante' with fair success, but, later, her luck took a marked change\r\n",
      "for the worse. I distinctly remember that in a single evening she lost\r\n",
      "an enormous sum. But worse was to ensue, for one fine morning her\r\n",
      "prince disappeared--horses, carriage, and all. Also, the hotel bill\r\n",
      "which he left unpaid was enormous. Upon this Mlle. Zelma (the name\r\n",
      "which she assumed after figuring as Madame Barberini) was in despair.\r\n",
      "She shrieked and howled all over the hotel, and even tore her clothes\r\n",
      "in her frenzy. In the hotel there was staying also a Polish count (you\r\n",
      "must know that ALL travelling Poles are counts!), and the spectacle of\r\n",
      "Mlle. Zelma tearing her clothes and, catlike, scratching her face with\r\n",
      "her beautiful, scented nails produced upon him a strong impression. So\r\n",
      "the pair had a talk together, and, by luncheon time, she was consoled.\r\n",
      "Indeed, that evening the couple entered the Casino arm-in-arm--Mlle.\r\n",
      "Zelma laughing loudly, according to her custom, and showing even more\r\n",
      "expansiveness in her manners than she had before shown. For instance,\r\n",
      "she thrust her way into the file of women roulette-players in the exact\r\n",
      "fashion of those ladies who, to clear a space for themselves at the\r\n",
      "tables, push their fellow-players roughly aside. Doubtless you have\r\n",
      "noticed them?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, certainly.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, they are not worth noticing. To the annoyance of the decent\r\n",
      "public they are allowed to remain here--at all events such of them as\r\n",
      "daily change 4000 franc notes at the tables (though, as soon as ever\r\n",
      "these women cease to do so, they receive an invitation to depart).\r\n",
      "However, Mlle. Zelma continued to change notes of this kind, but her\r\n",
      "play grew more and more unsuccessful, despite the fact that such\r\n",
      "ladies' luck is frequently good, for they have a surprising amount of\r\n",
      "cash at their disposal. Suddenly, the Count too disappeared, even as\r\n",
      "the Prince had done, and that same evening Mlle. Zelma was forced to\r\n",
      "appear in the Casino alone. On this occasion no one offered her a\r\n",

      "whereupon, after staking and losing her last louis d'or she chanced to\r\n",
      "look around her, and saw standing by her side the Baron Burmergelm, who\r\n",
      "had been eyeing her with fixed disapproval. To his distaste, however,\r\n",
      "Mlle. paid no attention, but, turning to him with her well-known smile,\r\n",
      "requested him to stake, on her behalf, ten louis on the red. Later that\r\n",
      "evening a complaint from the Baroness led the authorities to request\r\n",
      "Mlle. not to re-enter the Casino. If you feel in any way surprised that\r\n",
      "I should know these petty and unedifying details, the reason is that I\r\n",
      "had them from a relative of mine who, later that evening, drove Mlle.\r\n",
      "Zelma in his carriage from Roulettenberg to Spa. Now, mark you, Mlle.\r\n",
      "wants to become Madame General, in order that, in future, she may be\r\n",
      "spared the receipt of such invitations from Casino authorities as she\r\n",
      "received three years ago. At present she is not playing; but that is\r\n",
      "only because, according to the signs, she is lending money to other\r\n",
      "players. Yes, that is a much more paying game. I even suspect that the\r\n",
      "unfortunate General is himself in her debt, as well as, perhaps, also\r\n",
      "De Griers. Or, it may be that the latter has entered into a partnership\r\n",
      "with her. Consequently you yourself will see that, until the marriage\r\n",
      "shall have been consummated, Mlle. would scarcely like to have the\r\n",
      "attention of the Baron and the Baroness drawn to herself. In short, to\r\n",
      "any one in her position, a scandal would be most detrimental. You form\r\n",
      "a member of the menage of these people; wherefore, any act of yours\r\n",
      "might cause such a scandal--and the more so since daily she appears in\r\n",
      "public arm in arm with the General or with Mlle. Polina. NOW do you\r\n",
      "understand?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No, I do not!\" I shouted as I banged my fist down upon the\r\n",
      "table--banged it with such violence that a frightened waiter came\r\n",
      "running towards us. \"Tell me, Mr. Astley, why, if you knew this history\r\n",
      "all along, and, consequently, always knew who this Mlle. Blanche is,\r\n",
      "you never warned either myself or the General, nor, most of all, Mlle.\r\n",
      "Polina\" (who is accustomed to appear in the Casino--in public\r\n",
      "everywhere with Mlle. Blanche). \"How could you do it?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It would have done no good to warn you,\" he replied quietly, \"for the\r\n",
      "reason that you could have effected nothing. Against what was I to warn\r\n",
      "you? As likely as not, the General knows more about Mlle. Blanche even\r\n",
      "than I do; yet the unhappy man still walks about with her and Mlle.\r\n",
      "Polina. Only yesterday I saw this Frenchwoman riding, splendidly\r\n",
      "mounted, with De Griers, while the General was careering in their wake\r\n",
      "on a roan horse. He had said, that morning, that his legs were hurting\r\n",
      "him, yet his riding-seat was easy enough. As he passed I looked at him,\r\n",
      "and the thought occurred to me that he was a man lost for ever.\r\n",
      "However, it is no affair of mine, for I have only recently had the\r\n",
      "happiness to make Mlle. Polina's acquaintance. Also\"--he added this as\r\n",
      "an afterthought--\"I have already told you that I do not recognise your\r\n",
      "right to ask me certain questions, however sincere be my liking for\r\n",
      "you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Enough,\" I said, rising. \"To me it is as clear as day that Mlle.\r\n",
      "Polina knows all about this Mlle. Blanche, but cannot bring herself to\r\n",
      "part with her Frenchman; wherefore, she consents also to be seen in\r\n",
      "public with Mlle. Blanche. You may be sure that nothing else would ever\r\n",
      "have induced her either to walk about with this Frenchwoman or to send\r\n",
      "me a note not to touch the Baron. Yes, it is THERE that the influence\r\n",
      "lies before which everything in the world must bow! Yet she herself it\r\n",
      "was who launched me at the Baron! The devil take it, but I was left no\r\n",
      "choice in the matter.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You forget, in the first place, that this Mlle. de Cominges is the\r\n",
      "General's inamorata, and, in the second place, that Mlle. Polina, the\r\n",
      "General's step-daughter, has a younger brother and sister who, though\r\n",
      "they are the General's own children, are completely neglected by this\r\n",
      "madman, and robbed as well.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, yes; that is so. For me to go and desert the children now would\r\n",
      "mean their total abandonment; whereas, if I remain, I should be able to\r\n",
      "defend their interests, and, perhaps, to save a moiety of their\r\n",
      "property. Yes, yes; that is quite true. And yet, and yet--Oh, I can\r\n",
      "well understand why they are all so interested in the General's mother!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"In whom?\" asked Mr. Astley.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"In the old woman of Moscow who declines to die, yet concerning whom\r\n",
      "they are for ever expecting telegrams to notify the fact of her death.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah, then of course their interests centre around her. It is a question\r\n",
      "of succession. Let that but be settled, and the General will marry,\r\n",
      "Mlle. Polina will be set free, and De Griers--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, and De Griers?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Will be repaid his money, which is what he is now waiting for.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What? You think that he is waiting for that?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I know of nothing else,\" asserted Mr. Astley doggedly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But, I do, I do!\" I shouted in my fury. \"He is waiting also for the\r\n",
      "old woman's will, for the reason that it awards Mlle. Polina a dowry.\r\n",
      "As soon as ever the money is received, she will throw herself upon the\r\n",
      "Frenchman's neck. All women are like that. Even the proudest of them\r\n",
      "become abject slaves where marriage is concerned. What Polina is good\r\n",
      "for is to fall head over ears in love. That is MY opinion. Look at\r\n",
      "her--especially when she is sitting alone, and plunged in thought. All\r\n",
      "this was pre-ordained and foretold, and is accursed. Polina could\r\n",
      "perpetrate any mad act. She--she--But who called me by name?\" I broke\r\n",
      "off. \"Who is shouting for me? I heard some one calling in Russian,\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "At the moment, we were approaching my hotel. We had left the cafe long\r\n",
      "ago, without even noticing that we had done so.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, I DID hear a woman's voice calling, but whose I do not know. The\r\n",

      "last five years), as brisk, aggressive, self-satisfied, bolt-upright,\r\n",
      "loudly imperious, and generally abusive as ever. In fact, she looked\r\n",
      "exactly as she had on the only two occasions when I had seen her since\r\n",
      "my appointment to the General's household.  Naturally enough, I stood\r\n",
      "petrified with astonishment. She had sighted me a hundred paces off!\r\n",

      "tumbling over yourselves for? Why are you all tearing about? What\r\n",

      "direct to their rooms. Where are they lodging?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Madame was lifted up in her chair by the lacqueys, and I preceded her\r\n",
      "up the grand staircase. Our progress was exceedingly effective, for\r\n",
      "everyone whom we met stopped to stare at the cortege. It happened that\r\n",
      "the hotel had the reputation of being the best, the most expensive, and\r\n",
      "the most aristocratic in all the spa, and at every turn on the\r\n",
      "staircase or in the corridors we encountered fine ladies and\r\n",
      "important-looking Englishmen--more than one of whom hastened downstairs\r\n",
      "to inquire of the awestruck landlord who the newcomer was. To all such\r\n",
      "questions he returned the same answer--namely, that the old lady was an\r\n",
      "influential foreigner, a Russian, a Countess, and a grande dame, and\r\n",
      "that she had taken the suite which, during the previous week, had been\r\n",
      "tenanted by the Grande Duchesse de N.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Meanwhile the cause of the sensation--the Grandmother--was being borne\r\n",
      "aloft in her armchair. Every person whom she met she scanned with an\r\n",
      "inquisitive eye, after first of all interrogating me about him or her\r\n",
      "at the top of her voice. She was stout of figure, and, though she could\r\n",
      "not leave her chair, one felt, the moment that one first looked at her,\r\n",
      "that she was also tall of stature. Her back was as straight as a board,\r\n",
      "and never did she lean back in her seat. Also, her large grey head,\r\n",
      "with its keen, rugged features, remained always erect as she glanced\r\n",
      "about her in an imperious, challenging sort of way, with looks and\r\n",
      "gestures that clearly were unstudied. Though she had reached her\r\n",
      "seventy-sixth year, her face was still fresh, and her teeth had not\r\n",
      "decayed. Lastly, she was dressed in a black silk gown and white mobcap.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She interests me tremendously,\" whispered Mr. Astley as, still\r\n",
      "smoking, he walked by my side. Meanwhile I was reflecting that probably\r\n",
      "the old lady knew all about the telegrams, and even about De Griers,\r\n",
      "though little or nothing about Mlle. Blanche. I said as much to Mr.\r\n",
      "Astley.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But what a frail creature is man! No sooner was my first surprise\r\n",
      "abated than I found myself rejoicing in the shock which we were about\r\n",
      "to administer to the General. So much did the thought inspire me that I\r\n",
      "marched ahead in the gayest of fashions.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Our party was lodging on the third floor. Without knocking at the door,\r\n",
      "or in any way announcing our presence, I threw open the portals, and\r\n",
      "the Grandmother was borne through them in triumph. As though of set\r\n",
      "purpose, the whole party chanced at that moment to be assembled in the\r\n",
      "General's study. The time was eleven o'clock, and it seemed that an\r\n",
      "outing of some sort (at which a portion of the party were to drive in\r\n",
      "carriages, and others to ride on horseback, accompanied by one or two\r\n",
      "extraneous acquaintances) was being planned. The General was present,\r\n",
      "and also Polina, the children, the latter's nurses, De Griers, Mlle.\r\n",
      "Blanche (attired in a riding-habit), her mother, the young Prince, and\r\n",
      "a learned German whom I beheld for the first time. Into the midst of\r\n",
      "this assembly the lacqueys conveyed Madame in her chair, and set her\r\n",
      "down within three paces of the General!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Good heavens! Never shall I forget the spectacle which ensued! Just\r\n",
      "before our entry, the General had been holding forth to the company,\r\n",
      "with De Griers in support of him. I may also mention that, for the last\r\n",
      "two or three days, Mlle. Blanche and De Griers had been making a great\r\n",
      "deal of the young Prince, under the very nose of the poor General. In\r\n",
      "short, the company, though decorous and conventional, was in a gay,\r\n",
      "familiar mood. But no sooner did the Grandmother appear than the\r\n",
      "General stopped dead in the middle of a word, and, with jaw dropping,\r\n",
      "stared hard at the old lady--his eyes almost starting out of his head,\r\n",
      "and his expression as spellbound as though he had just seen a basilisk.\r\n",
      "In return, the Grandmother stared at him silently and without\r\n",
      "moving--though with a look of mingled challenge, triumph, and ridicule\r\n",
      "in her eyes. For ten seconds did the pair remain thus eyeing one\r\n",
      "another, amid the profound silence of the company; and even De Griers\r\n",
      "sat petrified--an extraordinary look of uneasiness dawning on his face.\r\n",
      "As for Mlle. Blanche, she too stared wildly at the Grandmother, with\r\n",
      "eyebrows raised and her lips parted--while the Prince and the German\r\n",
      "savant contemplated the tableau in profound amazement. Only Polina\r\n",
      "looked anything but perplexed or surprised. Presently, however, she too\r\n",
      "turned as white as a sheet, and then reddened to her temples. Truly the\r\n",
      "Grandmother's arrival seemed to be a catastrophe for everybody! For my\r\n",
      "own part, I stood looking from the Grandmother to the company, and back\r\n",
      "again, while Mr. Astley, as usual, remained in the background, and\r\n",
      "gazed calmly and decorously at the scene.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, here I am--and instead of a telegram, too!\" the Grandmother at\r\n",
      "last ejaculated, to dissipate the silence. \"What? You were not\r\n",
      "expecting me?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Antonida Vassilievna! O my dearest mother! But how on earth did you,\r\n",
      "did you--?\" The mutterings of the unhappy General died away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I verily believe that if the Grandmother had held her tongue a few\r\n",
      "seconds longer she would have had a stroke.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"How on earth did I WHAT?\" she exclaimed. \"Why, I just got into the\r\n",
      "train and came here. What else is the railway meant for? But you\r\n",
      "thought that I had turned up my toes and left my property to the lot of\r\n",
      "you. Oh, I know ALL about the telegrams which you have been\r\n",
      "dispatching. They must have cost you a pretty sum, I should think, for\r\n",
      "telegrams are not sent from abroad for nothing. Well, I picked up my\r\n",
      "heels, and came here. Who is this Frenchman? Monsieur de Griers, I\r\n",
      "suppose?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oui, madame,\" assented De Griers. \"Et, croyez, je suis si enchante!\r\n",
      "Votre sante--c'est un miracle vous voir ici. Une surprise charmante!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Just so. 'Charmante!' I happen to know you as a mountebank, and\r\n",
      "therefore trust you no more than THIS.\" She indicated her little\r\n",
      "finger. \"And who is THAT?\" she went on, turning towards Mlle. Blanche.\r\n",
      "Evidently the Frenchwoman looked so becoming in her riding-habit, with\r\n",
      "her whip in her hand, that she had made an impression upon the old\r\n",
      "lady. \"Who is that woman there?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Mlle. de Cominges,\" I said. \"And this is her mother, Madame de\r\n",
      "Cominges. They also are staying in the hotel.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Is the daughter married?\" asked the old lady, without the least\r\n",
      "semblance of ceremony.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No,\" I replied as respectfully as possible, but under my breath.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Is she good company?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I failed to understand the question.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I mean, is she or is she not a bore? Can she speak Russian? When this\r\n",
      "De Griers was in Moscow he soon learnt to make himself understood.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I explained to the old lady that Mlle. Blanche had never visited Russia.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Bonjour, then,\" said Madame, with sudden brusquerie.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Bonjour, madame,\" replied Mlle. Blanche with an elegant, ceremonious\r\n",
      "bow as, under cover of an unwonted modesty, she endeavoured to express,\r\n",
      "both in face and figure, her extreme surprise at such strange behaviour\r\n",
      "on the part of the Grandmother.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"How the woman sticks out her eyes at me! How she mows and minces!\" was\r\n",
      "the Grandmother's comment. Then she turned suddenly to the General, and\r\n",
      "continued: \"I have taken up my abode here, so am going to be your\r\n",
      "next-door neighbour. Are you glad to hear that, or are you not?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My dear mother, believe me when I say that I am sincerely delighted,\"\r\n",
      "returned the General, who had now, to a certain extent, recovered his\r\n",
      "senses; and inasmuch as, when occasion arose, he could speak with\r\n",
      "fluency, gravity, and a certain effect, he set himself to be expansive\r\n",
      "in his remarks, and went on: \"We have been so dismayed and upset by the\r\n",
      "news of your indisposition! We had received such hopeless telegrams\r\n",
      "about you! Then suddenly--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Fibs, fibs!\" interrupted the Grandmother.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"How on earth, too, did you come to decide upon the journey?\" continued\r\n",
      "the General, with raised voice as he hurried to overlook the old lady's\r\n",
      "last remark. \"Surely, at your age, and in your present state of health,\r\n",
      "the thing is so unexpected that our surprise is at least intelligible.\r\n",
      "However, I am glad to see you (as indeed, are we all\"--he said this\r\n",
      "with a dignified, yet conciliatory, smile), \"and will use my best\r\n",
      "endeavours to render your stay here as pleasant as possible.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Enough! All this is empty chatter. You are talking the usual nonsense.\r\n",
      "I shall know quite well how to spend my time. How did I come to\r\n",
      "undertake the journey, you ask? Well, is there anything so very\r\n",
      "surprising about it? It was done quite simply. What is every one going\r\n",
      "into ecstasies about?--How do you do, Prascovia? What are YOU doing\r\n",
      "here?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And how are YOU, Grandmother?\" replied Polina, as she approached the\r\n",
      "old lady. \"Were you long on the journey?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The most sensible question that I have yet been asked! Well, you shall\r\n",
      "hear for yourself how it all happened. I lay and lay, and was doctored\r\n",
      "and doctored, until at last I drove the physicians from me, and called\r\n",
      "in an apothecary from Nicolai who had cured an old woman of a malady\r\n",
      "similar to my own--cured her merely with a little hayseed. Well, he did\r\n",
      "me a great deal of good, for on the third day I broke into a sweat, and\r\n",
      "was able to leave my bed. Then my German doctors held another\r\n",
      "consultation, put on their spectacles, and told me that if I would go\r\n",
      "abroad, and take a course of the waters, the indisposition would\r\n",
      "finally pass away. 'Why should it not?' I thought to myself. So I had\r\n",
      "got things ready, and on the following day, a Friday, set out for here.\r\n",
      "I occupied a special compartment in the train, and where ever I had to\r\n",
      "change I found at the station bearers who were ready to carry me for a\r\n",
      "few coppers. You have nice quarters here,\" she went on as she glanced\r\n",
      "around the room. \"But where on earth did you get the money for them, my\r\n",
      "good sir? I thought that everything of yours had been mortgaged? This\r\n",
      "Frenchman alone must be your creditor for a good deal. Oh, I know all\r\n",
      "about it, all about it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I-I am surprised at you, my dearest mother,\" said the General in some\r\n",
      "confusion. \"I-I am greatly surprised. But I do not need any extraneous\r\n",
      "control of my finances. Moreover, my expenses do not exceed my income,\r\n",
      "and we--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"They do not exceed it? Fie! Why, you are robbing your children of\r\n",
      "their last kopeck--you, their guardian!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"After this,\" said the General, completely taken aback, \"--after what\r\n",
      "you have just said, I do not know whether--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You do not know what? By heavens, are you never going to drop that\r\n",
      "roulette of yours? Are you going to whistle all your property away?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This made such an impression upon the General that he almost choked\r\n",
      "with fury.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Roulette, indeed? I play roulette? Really, in view of my\r\n",
      "position--Recollect what you are saying, my dearest mother. You must\r\n",
      "still be unwell.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Rubbish, rubbish!\" she retorted. \"The truth is that you CANNOT be got\r\n",
      "away from that roulette. You are simply telling lies. This very day I\r\n",
      "mean to go and see for myself what roulette is like. Prascovia, tell me\r\n",
      "what there is to be seen here; and do you, Alexis Ivanovitch, show me\r\n",
      "everything; and do you, Potapitch, make me a list of excursions. What\r\n",
      "IS there to be seen?\" again she inquired of Polina.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"There is a ruined castle, and the Shlangenberg.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The Shlangenberg? What is it? A forest?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No, a mountain on the summit of which there is a place fenced off.\r\n",
      "From it you can get a most beautiful view.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Could a chair be carried up that mountain of yours?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Doubtless we could find bearers for the purpose,\" I interposed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At this moment Theodosia, the nursemaid, approached the old lady with\r\n",
      "the General's children.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No, I DON'T want to see them,\" said the Grandmother. \"I hate kissing\r\n",
      "children, for their noses are always wet. How are you getting on,\r\n",
      "Theodosia?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I am very well, thank you, Madame,\" replied the nursemaid. \"And how is\r\n",
      "your ladyship? We have been feeling so anxious about you!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, I know, you simple soul--But who are those other guests?\" the old\r\n",
      "lady continued, turning again to Polina. \"For instance, who is that old\r\n",
      "rascal in the spectacles?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Prince Nilski, Grandmamma,\" whispered Polina.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, a Russian? Why, I had no idea that he could understand me! Surely\r\n",
      "he did not hear what I said? As for Mr. Astley, I have seen him\r\n",
      "already, and I see that he is here again. How do you do?\" she added to\r\n",
      "the gentleman in question.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Astley bowed in silence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Have you NOTHING to say to me?\" the old lady went on. \"Say something,\r\n",
      "for goodness' sake! Translate to him, Polina.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Polina did so.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I have only to say,\" replied Mr. Astley gravely, but also with\r\n",
      "alacrity, \"that I am indeed glad to see you in such good health.\" This\r\n",
      "was interpreted to the Grandmother, and she seemed much gratified.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"How well English people know how to answer one!\" she remarked. \"That\r\n",
      "is why I like them so much better than French. Come here,\" she added to\r\n",
      "Mr. Astley. \"I will try not to bore you too much. Polina, translate to\r\n",
      "him that I am staying in rooms on a lower floor. Yes, on a lower\r\n",
      "floor,\" she repeated to Astley, pointing downwards with her finger.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Astley looked pleased at receiving the invitation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Next, the old lady scanned Polina, from head to foot with minute\r\n",
      "attention.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I could almost have liked you, Prascovia,\" suddenly she remarked, \"for\r\n",
      "you are a nice girl--the best of the lot. You have some character about\r\n",
      "you. I too have character. Turn round. Surely that is not false hair\r\n",
      "that you are wearing?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No, Grandmamma. It is my own.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, well. I do not like the stupid fashions of today. You are very\r\n",
      "good looking. I should have fallen in love with you if I had been a\r\n",
      "man. Why do you not get married? It is time now that I was going. I\r\n",
      "want to walk, yet I always have to ride. Are you still in a bad\r\n",
      "temper?\" she added to the General.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No, indeed,\" rejoined the now mollified General.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I quite understand that at your time of life--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Cette vieille est tombee en enfance,\" De Griers whispered to me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But I want to look round a little,\" the old lady added to the General.\r\n",
      "Will you lend me Alexis Ivanovitch for the purpose?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"As much as you like. But I myself--yes, and Polina and Monsieur de\r\n",
      "Griers too--we all of us hope to have the pleasure of escorting you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Mais, madame, cela sera un plaisir,\" De Griers commented with a\r\n",
      "bewitching smile.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"'Plaisir' indeed! Why, I look upon you as a perfect fool, monsieur.\"\r\n",
      "Then she remarked to the General: \"I am not going to let you have any\r\n",
      "of my money. I must be off to my rooms now, to see what they are like.\r\n",
      "Afterwards we will look round a little. Lift me up.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Again the Grandmother was borne aloft and carried down the staircase\r\n",
      "amid a perfect bevy of followers--the General walking as though he had\r\n",
      "been hit over the head with a cudgel, and De Griers seeming to be\r\n",
      "plunged in thought. Endeavouring to be left behind, Mlle. Blanche next\r\n",
      "thought better of it, and followed the rest, with the Prince in her\r\n",
      "wake. Only the German savant and Madame de Cominges did not leave the\r\n",
      "General's apartments.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "X\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At spas--and, probably, all over Europe--hotel landlords and managers\r\n",
      "are guided in their allotment of rooms to visitors, not so much by the\r\n",
      "wishes and requirements of those visitors, as by their personal\r\n",
      "estimate of the same. It may also be said that these landlords and\r\n",
      "managers seldom make a mistake. To the Grandmother, however, our\r\n",
      "landlord, for some reason or another, allotted such a sumptuous suite\r\n",
      "that he fairly overreached himself; for he assigned her a suite\r\n",
      "consisting of four magnificently appointed rooms, with bathroom,\r\n",
      "servants' quarters, a separate room for her maid, and so on. In fact,\r\n",
      "during the previous week the suite had been occupied by no less a\r\n",
      "personage than a Grand Duchess: which circumstance was duly explained\r\n",
      "to the new occupant, as an excuse for raising the price of these\r\n",
      "apartments. The Grandmother had herself carried--or, rather,\r\n",
      "wheeled--through each room in turn, in order that she might subject the\r\n",
      "whole to a close and attentive scrutiny; while the landlord--an\r\n",
      "elderly, bald-headed man--walked respectfully by her side.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "What every one took the Grandmother to be I do not know, but it\r\n",
      "appeared, at least, that she was accounted a person not only of great\r\n",
      "importance, but also, and still more, of great wealth; and without\r\n",
      "delay they entered her in the hotel register as \"Madame la Generale,\r\n",
      "Princesse de Tarassevitcheva,\" although she had never been a princess\r\n",
      "in her life. Her retinue, her reserved compartment in the train, her\r\n",
      "pile of unnecessary trunks, portmanteaux, and strong-boxes, all helped\r\n",
      "to increase her prestige; while her wheeled chair, her sharp tone and\r\n",
      "voice, her eccentric questions (put with an air of the most overbearing\r\n",
      "and unbridled imperiousness), her whole figure--upright, rugged, and\r\n",
      "commanding as it was--completed the general awe in which she was held.\r\n",
      "As she inspected her new abode she ordered her chair to be stopped at\r\n",
      "intervals in order that, with finger extended towards some article of\r\n",
      "furniture, she might ply the respectfully smiling, yet secretly\r\n",
      "apprehensive, landlord with unexpected questions. She addressed them to\r\n",
      "him in French, although her pronunciation of the language was so bad\r\n",
      "that sometimes I had to translate them. For the most part, the\r\n",
      "landlord's answers were unsatisfactory, and failed to please her; nor\r\n",
      "were the questions themselves of a practical nature, but related,\r\n",
      "generally, to God knows what.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For instance, on one occasion she halted before a picture which, a poor\r\n",
      "copy of a well-known original, had a mythological subject.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Of whom is this a portrait?\" she inquired.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The landlord explained that it was probably that of a countess.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But how know you that?\" the old lady retorted.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You live here, yet you cannot say for certain! And why is the picture\r\n",
      "there at all? And why do its eyes look so crooked?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To all these questions the landlord could return no satisfactory reply,\r\n",
      "despite his floundering endeavours.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The blockhead!\" exclaimed the Grandmother in Russian.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then she proceeded on her way--only to repeat the same story in front\r\n",
      "of a Saxon statuette which she had sighted from afar, and had\r\n",
      "commanded, for some reason or another, to be brought to her. Finally,\r\n",
      "she inquired of the landlord what was the value of the carpet in her\r\n",
      "bedroom, as well as where the said carpet had been manufactured; but,\r\n",
      "the landlord could do no more than promise to make inquiries.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What donkeys these people are!\" she commented. Next, she turned her\r\n",
      "attention to the bed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What a huge counterpane!\" she exclaimed. \"Turn it back, please.\" The\r\n",
      "lacqueys did so.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Further yet, further yet,\" the old lady cried. \"Turn it RIGHT back.\r\n",
      "Also, take off those pillows and bolsters, and lift up the feather bed.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The bed was opened for her inspection.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Mercifully it contains no bugs,\" she remarked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Pull off the whole thing, and then put on my own pillows and sheets.\r\n",
      "The place is too luxurious for an old woman like myself. It is too\r\n",
      "large for any one person. Alexis Ivanovitch, come and see me whenever\r\n",
      "you are not teaching your pupils.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"After tomorrow I shall no longer be in the General's service,\" I\r\n",
      "replied, \"but merely living in the hotel on my own account.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why so?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Because, the other day, there arrived from Berlin a German and his\r\n",
      "wife--persons of some importance; and, it chanced that, when taking a\r\n",
      "walk, I spoke to them in German without having properly compassed the\r\n",
      "Berlin accent.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Indeed?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes: and this action on my part the Baron held to be an insult, and\r\n",
      "complained about it to the General, who yesterday dismissed me from his\r\n",
      "employ.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But I suppose you must have threatened that precious Baron, or\r\n",
      "something of the kind? However, even if you did so, it was a matter of\r\n",
      "no moment.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No, I did not. The Baron was the aggressor by raising his stick at me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Upon that the Grandmother turned sharply to the General.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What? You permitted yourself to treat your tutor thus, you nincompoop,\r\n",
      "and to dismiss him from his post? You are a blockhead--an utter\r\n",
      "blockhead! I can see that clearly.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do not alarm yourself, my dear mother,\" the General replied with a\r\n",
      "lofty air--an air in which there was also a tinge of familiarity. \"I am\r\n",
      "quite capable of managing my own affairs. Moreover, Alexis Ivanovitch\r\n",
      "has not given you a true account of the matter.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What did you do next?\" The old lady inquired of me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I wanted to challenge the Baron to a duel,\" I replied as modestly as\r\n",
      "possible; \"but the General protested against my doing so.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And WHY did you so protest?\" she inquired of the General. Then she\r\n",
      "turned to the landlord, and questioned him as to whether HE would not\r\n",
      "have fought a duel, if challenged. \"For,\" she added, \"I can see no\r\n",
      "difference between you and the Baron; nor can I bear that German visage\r\n",
      "of yours.\" Upon this the landlord bowed and departed, though he could\r\n",
      "not have understood the Grandmother's compliment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Pardon me, Madame,\" the General continued with a sneer, \"but are duels\r\n",
      "really feasible?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why not? All men are crowing cocks, and that is why they quarrel. YOU,\r\n",
      "though, I perceive, are a blockhead--a man who does not even know how\r\n",
      "to carry his breeding. Lift me up. Potapitch, see to it that you always\r\n",
      "have TWO bearers ready. Go and arrange for their hire. But we shall not\r\n",
      "require more than two, for I shall need only to be carried upstairs. On\r\n",
      "the level or in the street I can be WHEELED along. Go and tell them\r\n",
      "that, and pay them in advance, so that they may show me some respect.\r\n",
      "You too, Potapitch, are always to come with me, and YOU, Alexis\r\n",
      "Ivanovitch, are to point out to me this Baron as we go along, in order\r\n",
      "that I may get a squint at the precious 'Von.' And where is that\r\n",
      "roulette played?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I explained to her that the game was carried on in the salons of the\r\n",
      "Casino; whereupon there ensued a string of questions as to whether\r\n",
      "there were many such salons, whether many people played in them,\r\n",
      "whether those people played a whole day at a time, and whether the game\r\n",
      "was managed according to fixed rules. At length, I thought it best to\r\n",
      "say that the most advisable course would be for her to go and see it\r\n",
      "for herself, since a mere description of it would be a difficult matter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then take me straight there,\" she said, \"and do you walk on in front\r\n",
      "of me, Alexis Ivanovitch.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What, mother? Before you have so much as rested from your journey?\"\r\n",
      "the General inquired with some solicitude. Also, for some reason which\r\n",
      "I could not divine, he seemed to be growing nervous; and, indeed, the\r\n",
      "whole party was evincing signs of confusion, and exchanging glances\r\n",
      "with one another. Probably they were thinking that it would be a\r\n",
      "ticklish--even an embarrassing--business to accompany the Grandmother\r\n",
      "to the Casino, where, very likely, she would perpetrate further\r\n",
      "eccentricities, and in public too! Yet on their own initiative they had\r\n",
      "offered to escort her!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why should I rest?\" she retorted. \"I am not tired, for I have been\r\n",
      "sitting still these past five days. Let us see what your medicinal\r\n",
      "springs and waters are like, and where they are situated. What, too,\r\n",
      "about that, that--what did you call it, Prascovia?--oh, about that\r\n",
      "mountain top?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, we are going to see it, Grandmamma.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Very well. Is there anything else for me to see here?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes! Quite a number of things,\" Polina forced herself to say.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Martha, YOU must come with me as well,\" went on the old lady to her\r\n",
      "maid.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No, no, mother!\" ejaculated the General. \"Really she cannot come. They\r\n",
      "would not admit even Potapitch to the Casino.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Rubbish! Because she is my servant, is that a reason for turning her\r\n",
      "out? Why, she is only a human being like the rest of us; and as she has\r\n",
      "been travelling for a week she might like to look about her. With whom\r\n",
      "else could she go out but myself? She would never dare to show her nose\r\n",
      "in the street alone.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But, mother--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Are you ashamed to be seen with me? Stop at home, then, and you will\r\n",
      "be asked no questions. A pretty General YOU are, to be sure! I am a\r\n",
      "general's widow myself. But, after all, why should I drag the whole\r\n",
      "party with me? I will go and see the sights with only Alexis Ivanovitch\r\n",
      "as my escort.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "De Griers strongly insisted that EVERY ONE ought to accompany her.\r\n",
      "Indeed, he launched out into a perfect shower of charming phrases\r\n",
      "concerning the pleasure of acting as her cicerone, and so forth. Every\r\n",
      "one was touched with his words.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Mais elle est tombee en enfance,\" he added aside to the General.\r\n",
      "\"Seule, elle fera des betises.\" More than this I could not overhear,\r\n",
      "but he seemed to have got some plan in his mind, or even to be feeling\r\n",
      "a slight return of his hopes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The distance to the Casino was about half a verst, and our route led us\r\n",
      "through the Chestnut Avenue until we reached the square directly\r\n",
      "fronting the building. The General, I could see, was a trifle reassured\r\n",
      "by the fact that, though our progress was distinctly eccentric in its\r\n",
      "nature, it was, at least, correct and orderly. As a matter of fact, the\r\n",
      "spectacle of a person who is unable to walk is not anything to excite\r\n",
      "surprise at a spa. Yet it was clear that the General had a great fear\r\n",
      "of the Casino itself: for why should a person who had lost the use of\r\n",
      "her limbs--more especially an old woman--be going to rooms which were\r\n",
      "set apart only for roulette? On either side of the wheeled chair walked\r\n",
      "Polina and Mlle. Blanche--the latter smiling, modestly jesting, and, in\r\n",
      "short, making herself so agreeable to the Grandmother that in the end\r\n",
      "the old lady relented towards her. On the other side of the chair\r\n",
      "Polina had to answer an endless flow of petty questions--such as \"Who\r\n",
      "was it passed just now?\" \"Who is that coming along?\" \"Is the town a\r\n",
      "large one?\" \"Are the public gardens extensive?\" \"What sort of trees are\r\n",
      "those?\" \"What is the name of those hills?\" \"Do I see eagles flying\r\n",
      "yonder?\" \"What is that absurd-looking building?\" and so forth.\r\n",
      "Meanwhile Astley whispered to me, as he walked by my side, that he\r\n",
      "looked for much to happen that morning. Behind the old lady's chair\r\n",
      "marched Potapitch and Martha--Potapitch in his frockcoat and white\r\n",
      "waistcoat, with a cloak over all, and the forty-year-old and rosy, but\r\n",
      "slightly grey-headed, Martha in a mobcap, cotton dress, and squeaking\r\n",
      "shoes. Frequently the old lady would twist herself round to converse\r\n",
      "with these servants. As for De Griers, he spoke as though he had made\r\n",
      "up his mind to do something (though it is also possible that he spoke\r\n",
      "in this manner merely in order to hearten the General, with whom he\r\n",
      "appeared to have held a conference). But, alas, the Grandmother had\r\n",
      "uttered the fatal words, \"I am not going to give you any of my money;\"\r\n",
      "and though De Griers might regard these words lightly, the General knew\r\n",
      "his mother better. Also, I noticed that De Griers and Mlle. Blanche\r\n",
      "were still exchanging looks; while of the Prince and the German savant\r\n",
      "I lost sight at the end of the Avenue, where they had turned back and\r\n",
      "left us.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Into the Casino we marched in triumph. At once, both in the person of\r\n",
      "the commissionaire and in the persons of the footmen, there sprang to\r\n",
      "life the same reverence as had arisen in the lacqueys of the hotel. Yet\r\n",
      "it was not without some curiosity that they eyed us.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Without loss of time, the Grandmother gave orders that she should be\r\n",
      "wheeled through every room in the establishment; of which apartments\r\n",
      "she praised a few, while to others she remained indifferent. Concerning\r\n",
      "everything, however, she asked questions. Finally we reached the\r\n",
      "gaming-salons, where a lacquey who was, acting as guard over the doors,\r\n",
      "flung them open as though he were a man possessed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Grandmother's entry into the roulette-salon produced a profound\r\n",
      "impression upon the public. Around the tables, and at the further end\r\n",
      "of the room where the trente-et-quarante table was set out, there may\r\n",
      "have been gathered from 150 to 200 gamblers, ranged in several rows.\r\n",
      "Those who had succeeded in pushing their way to the tables were\r\n",
      "standing with their feet firmly planted, in order to avoid having to\r\n",
      "give up their places until they should have finished their game (since\r\n",
      "merely to stand looking on--thus occupying a gambler's place for\r\n",
      "nothing--was not permitted). True, chairs were provided around the\r\n",
      "tables, but few players made use of them--more especially if there was\r\n",
      "a large attendance of the general public; since to stand allowed of a\r\n",
      "closer approach; and, therefore, of greater facilities for calculation\r\n",
      "and staking. Behind the foremost row were herded a second and a third\r\n",
      "row of people awaiting their turn; but sometimes their impatience led\r\n",
      "these people to stretch a hand through the first row, in order to\r\n",
      "deposit their stakes. Even third-row individuals would dart forward to\r\n",
      "stake; whence seldom did more than five or ten minutes pass without a\r\n",
      "scene over disputed money arising at one or another end of the table.\r\n",
      "On the other hand, the police of the Casino were an able body of men;\r\n",
      "and though to escape the crush was an impossibility, however much one\r\n",
      "might wish it, the eight croupiers apportioned to each table kept an\r\n",
      "eye upon the stakes, performed the necessary reckoning, and decided\r\n",
      "disputes as they arose.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the last resort they always called in the Casino police, and the\r\n",
      "disputes would immediately come to an end. Policemen were stationed\r\n",
      "about the Casino in ordinary costume, and mingled with the spectators\r\n",
      "so as to make it impossible to recognise them. In particular they kept\r\n",
      "a lookout for pickpockets and swindlers, who simply swanned in the\r\n",
      "roulette salons, and reaped a rich harvest. Indeed, in every direction\r\n",
      "money was being filched from pockets or purses--though, of course, if\r\n",
      "the attempt miscarried, a great uproar ensued. One had only to approach\r\n",
      "a roulette table, begin to play, and then openly grab some one else's\r\n",
      "winnings, for a din to be raised, and the thief to start vociferating\r\n",
      "that the stake was HIS; and, if the coup had been carried out with\r\n",
      "sufficient skill, and the witnesses wavered at all in their testimony,\r\n",
      "the thief would as likely as not succeed in getting away with the\r\n",
      "money, provided that the sum was not a large one--not large enough to\r\n",
      "have attracted the attention of the croupiers or some fellow-player.\r\n",
      "Moreover, if it were a stake of insignificant size, its true owner\r\n",
      "would sometimes decline to continue the dispute, rather than become\r\n",
      "involved in a scandal. Conversely, if the thief was detected, he was\r\n",
      "ignominiously expelled the building.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Upon all this the Grandmother gazed with open-eyed curiosity; and, on\r\n",
      "some thieves happening to be turned out of the place, she was\r\n",
      "delighted. Trente-et-quarante interested her but little; she preferred\r\n",
      "roulette, with its ever-revolving wheel. At length she expressed a wish\r\n",
      "to view the game closer; whereupon in some mysterious manner, the\r\n",
      "lacqueys and other officious agents (especially one or two ruined Poles\r\n",
      "of the kind who keep offering their services to successful gamblers and\r\n",
      "foreigners in general) at once found and cleared a space for the old\r\n",
      "lady among the crush, at the very centre of one of the tables, and next\r\n",
      "to the chief croupier; after which they wheeled her chair thither. Upon\r\n",
      "this a number of visitors who were not playing, but only looking on\r\n",
      "(particularly some Englishmen with their families), pressed closer\r\n",
      "forward towards the table, in order to watch the old lady from among\r\n",
      "the ranks of the gamblers. Many a lorgnette I saw turned in her\r\n",
      "direction, and the croupiers' hopes rose high that such an eccentric\r\n",
      "player was about to provide them with something out of the common. An\r\n",
      "old lady of seventy-five years who, though unable to walk, desired to\r\n",
      "play was not an everyday phenomenon. I too pressed forward towards the\r\n",
      "table, and ranged myself by the Grandmother's side; while Martha and\r\n",
      "Potapitch remained somewhere in the background among the crowd, and the\r\n",
      "General, Polina, and De Griers, with Mlle. Blanche, also remained\r\n",
      "hidden among the spectators.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At first the old lady did no more than watch the gamblers, and ply me,\r\n",
      "in a half-whisper, with sharp-broken questions as to who was so-and-so.\r\n",
      "Especially did her favour light upon a very young man who was plunging\r\n",
      "heavily, and had won (so it was whispered) as much as 40,000 francs,\r\n",
      "which were lying before him on the table in a heap of gold and\r\n",
      "bank-notes. His eyes kept flashing, and his hands shaking; yet all the\r\n",
      "while he staked without any sort of calculation--just what came to his\r\n",
      "hand, as he kept winning and winning, and raking and raking in his\r\n",
      "gains. Around him lacqueys fussed--placing chairs just behind where he\r\n",
      "was standing--and clearing the spectators from his vicinity, so that he\r\n",
      "should have more room, and not be crowded--the whole done, of course,\r\n",
      "in expectation of a generous largesse. From time to time other gamblers\r\n",
      "would hand him part of their winnings--being glad to let him stake for\r\n",
      "them as much as his hand could grasp; while beside him stood a Pole in\r\n",
      "a state of violent, but respectful, agitation, who, also in expectation\r\n",
      "of a generous largesse, kept whispering to him at intervals (probably\r\n",
      "telling him what to stake, and advising and directing his play). Yet\r\n",
      "never once did the player throw him a glance as he staked and staked,\r\n",
      "and raked in his winnings. Evidently, the player in question was dead\r\n",
      "to all besides.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For a few minutes the Grandmother watched him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Go and tell him,\" suddenly she exclaimed with a nudge at my elbow,\r\n",
      "\"--go and tell him to stop, and to take his money with him, and go\r\n",
      "home. Presently he will be losing--yes, losing everything that he has\r\n",
      "now won.\" She seemed almost breathless with excitement.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Where is Potapitch?\" she continued. \"Send Potapitch to speak to him.\r\n",
      "No, YOU must tell him, you must tell him,\"--here she nudged me\r\n",
      "again--\"for I have not the least notion where Potapitch is. Sortez,\r\n",
      "sortez,\" she shouted to the young man, until I leant over in her\r\n",
      "direction and whispered in her ear that no shouting was allowed, nor\r\n",
      "even loud speaking, since to do so disturbed the calculations of the\r\n",
      "players, and might lead to our being ejected.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"How provoking!\" she retorted. \"Then the young man is done for! I\r\n",
      "suppose he WISHES to be ruined. Yet I could not bear to see him have to\r\n",
      "return it all. What a fool the fellow is!\" and the old lady turned\r\n",
      "sharply away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On the left, among the players at the other half of the table, a young\r\n",
      "lady was playing, with, beside her, a dwarf. Who the dwarf may have\r\n",
      "been--whether a relative or a person whom she took with her to act as a\r\n",
      "foil--I do not know; but I had noticed her there on previous occasions,\r\n",
      "since, everyday, she entered the Casino at one o'clock precisely, and\r\n",
      "departed at two--thus playing for exactly one hour. Being well-known to\r\n",
      "the attendants, she always had a seat provided for her; and, taking\r\n",
      "some gold and a few thousand-franc notes out of her pocket--would begin\r\n",
      "quietly, coldly, and after much calculation, to stake, and mark down\r\n",
      "the figures in pencil on a paper, as though striving to work out a\r\n",
      "system according to which, at given moments, the odds might group\r\n",
      "themselves. Always she staked large coins, and either lost or won one,\r\n",
      "two, or three thousand francs a day, but not more; after which she\r\n",
      "would depart. The Grandmother took a long look at her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"THAT woman is not losing,\" she said. \"To whom does she belong? Do you\r\n",
      "know her? Who is she?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She is, I believe, a Frenchwoman,\" I replied.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah! A bird of passage, evidently. Besides, I can see that she has her\r\n",
      "shoes polished. Now, explain to me the meaning of each round in the\r\n",
      "game, and the way in which one ought to stake.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Upon this I set myself to explain the meaning of all the\r\n",
      "combinations--of \"rouge et noir,\" of \"pair et impair,\" of \"manque et\r\n",
      "passe,\" with, lastly, the different values in the system of numbers.\r\n",
      "The Grandmother listened attentively, took notes, put questions in\r\n",
      "various forms, and laid the whole thing to heart. Indeed, since an\r\n",
      "example of each system of stakes kept constantly occurring, a great\r\n",
      "deal of information could be assimilated with ease and celerity. The\r\n",
      "Grandmother was vastly pleased.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But what is zero?\" she inquired. \"Just now I heard the flaxen-haired\r\n",
      "croupier call out 'zero!' And why does he keep raking in all the money\r\n",
      "that is on the table? To think that he should grab the whole pile for\r\n",
      "himself! What does zero mean?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Zero is what the bank takes for itself. If the wheel stops at that\r\n",
      "figure, everything lying on the table becomes the absolute property of\r\n",
      "the bank. Also, whenever the wheel has begun to turn, the bank ceases\r\n",
      "to pay out anything.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then I should receive nothing if I were staking?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No; unless by any chance you had PURPOSELY staked on zero; in which\r\n",
      "case you would receive thirty-five times the value of your stake.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why thirty-five times, when zero so often turns up? And if so, why do\r\n",
      "not more of these fools stake upon it?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Because the number of chances against its occurrence is thirty-six.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Rubbish! Potapitch, Potapitch! Come here, and I will give you some\r\n",
      "money.\" The old lady took out of her pocket a tightly-clasped purse,\r\n",
      "and extracted from its depths a ten-gulden piece. \"Go at once, and\r\n",
      "stake that upon zero.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But, Madame, zero has only this moment turned up,\" I remonstrated;\r\n",
      "\"wherefore, it may not do so again for ever so long. Wait a little, and\r\n",
      "you may then have a better chance.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Rubbish! Stake, please.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Pardon me, but zero might not turn up again until, say, tonight, even\r\n",
      "though you had staked thousands upon it. It often happens so.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Rubbish, rubbish! Who fears the wolf should never enter the forest.\r\n",
      "What? We have lost? Then stake again.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A second ten-gulden piece did we lose, and then I put down a third. The\r\n",
      "Grandmother could scarcely remain seated in her chair, so intent was\r\n",
      "she upon the little ball as it leapt through the notches of the\r\n",
      "ever-revolving wheel. However, the third ten-gulden piece followed the\r\n",
      "first two. Upon this the Grandmother went perfectly crazy. She could no\r\n",
      "longer sit still, and actually struck the table with her fist when the\r\n",
      "croupier cried out, \"Trente-six,\" instead of the desiderated zero.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"To listen to him!\" fumed the old lady. \"When will that accursed zero\r\n",
      "ever turn up? I cannot breathe until I see it. I believe that that\r\n",
      "infernal croupier is PURPOSELY keeping it from turning up. Alexis\r\n",
      "Ivanovitch, stake TWO golden pieces this time. The moment we cease to\r\n",
      "stake, that cursed zero will come turning up, and we shall get nothing.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My good Madame--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Stake, stake! It is not YOUR money.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Accordingly I staked two ten-gulden pieces. The ball went hopping round\r\n",
      "the wheel until it began to settle through the notches. Meanwhile the\r\n",
      "Grandmother sat as though petrified, with my hand convulsively clutched\r\n",
      "in hers.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Zero!\" called the croupier.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"There! You see, you see!\" cried the old lady, as she turned and faced\r\n",
      "me, wreathed in smiles. \"I told you so! It was the Lord God himself who\r\n",
      "suggested to me to stake those two coins. Now, how much ought I to\r\n",
      "receive? Why do they not pay it out to me? Potapitch! Martha! Where are\r\n",
      "they? What has become of our party? Potapitch, Potapitch!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Presently, Madame,\" I whispered. \"Potapitch is outside, and they would\r\n",
      "decline to admit him to these rooms. See! You are being paid out your\r\n",
      "money. Pray take it.\" The croupiers were making up a heavy packet of\r\n",
      "coins, sealed in blue paper, and containing fifty ten gulden pieces,\r\n",
      "together with an unsealed packet containing another twenty. I handed\r\n",
      "the whole to the old lady in a money-shovel.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Faites le jeu, messieurs! Faites le jeu, messieurs! Rien ne va plus,\"\r\n",
      "proclaimed the croupier as once more he invited the company to stake,\r\n",
      "and prepared to turn the wheel.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"We shall be too late! He is going to spin again! Stake, stake!\" The\r\n",
      "Grandmother was in a perfect fever. \"Do not hang back! Be quick!\" She\r\n",
      "seemed almost beside herself, and nudged me as hard as she could.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Upon what shall I stake, Madame?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Upon zero, upon zero! Again upon zero! Stake as much as ever you can.\r\n",
      "How much have we got? Seventy ten-gulden pieces? We shall not miss\r\n",
      "them, so stake twenty pieces at a time.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Think a moment, Madame. Sometimes zero does not turn up for two\r\n",
      "hundred rounds in succession. I assure you that you may lose all your\r\n",
      "capital.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You are wrong--utterly wrong. Stake, I tell you! What a chattering\r\n",
      "tongue you have! I know perfectly well what I am doing.\" The old lady\r\n",
      "was shaking with excitement.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "have I seen so much money. And there were gentlefolk around it, and\r\n",
      "other gentlefolk sitting down. So, I asked Potapitch where all these\r\n",
      "gentry had come from; for, thought I, maybe the Holy Mother of God will\r\n",

      "meanwhile, good-bye. Do not forget to call a doctor, for I must take\r\n",

      "General. The factor of the Grandmother's appearance in place of the\r\n",
      "hourly expected telegram to announce her death (with, of course,\r\n",

      "projects that it was with a decided feeling of apprehension and growing\r\n",
      "paralysis that the conspirators viewed any future performances of the\r\n",
      "old lady at roulette. Yet this second factor was not quite so important\r\n",
      "as the first, since, though the Grandmother had twice declared that she\r\n",
      "did not intend to give the General any money, that declaration was not\r\n",
      "a complete ground for the abandonment of hope. Certainly De Griers,\r\n",

      "lost courage; and I felt sure that Mlle. Blanche also--Mlle. Blanche\r\n",
      "who was not only as deeply involved as the other two, but also\r\n",
      "expectant of becoming Madame General and an important legatee--would\r\n",
      "not lightly surrender the position, but would use her every resource of\r\n",
      "coquetry upon the old lady, in order to afford a contrast to the\r\n",
      "impetuous Polina, who was difficult to understand, and lacked the art\r\n",

      "when, overjoyed at winning, the Grandmother was distributing alms right\r\n",
      "and left, and taking every one to be a beggar, she again snapped out to\r\n",

      "having left the old lady's rooms, I was ascending to my own room on the\r\n",

      "the chief, the stoutest, threads which united the various actors in the\r\n",
      "drama, I had, until now, been ignorant of the methods and secrets of\r\n",
      "the game. For Polina had never been completely open with me. Although,\r\n",
      "on occasions, it had happened that involuntarily, as it were, she had\r\n",
      "revealed to me something of her heart, I had noticed that in most\r\n",
      "cases--in fact, nearly always--she had either laughed away these\r\n",
      "revelations, or grown confused, or purposely imparted to them a false\r\n",
      "guise. Yes, she must have concealed a great deal from me. But, I had a\r\n",
      "presentiment that now the end of this strained and mysterious situation\r\n",
      "was approaching. Another stroke, and all would be finished and exposed.\r\n",
      "Of my own fortunes, interested though I was in the affair, I took no\r\n",
      "account. I was in the strange position of possessing but two hundred\r\n",
      "gulden, of being at a loose end, of lacking both a post, the means of\r\n",
      "subsistence, a shred of hope, and any plans for the future, yet of\r\n",
      "caring nothing for these things. Had not my mind been so full of\r\n",
      "Polina, I should have given myself up to the comical piquancy of the\r\n",
      "impending denouement, and laughed my fill at it. But the thought of\r\n",
      "Polina was torture to me. That her fate was settled I already had an\r\n",
      "inkling; yet that was not the thought which was giving me so much\r\n",
      "uneasiness. What I really wished for was to penetrate her secrets. I\r\n",
      "wanted her to come to me and say, \"I love you,\" and, if she would not\r\n",
      "so come, or if to hope that she would ever do so was an unthinkable\r\n",
      "absurdity--why, then there was nothing else for me to want. Even now I\r\n",
      "do not know what I am wanting. I feel like a man who has lost his way.\r\n",
      "I yearn but to be in her presence, and within the circle of her light\r\n",
      "and splendour--to be there now, and forever, and for the whole of my\r\n",
      "life. More I do not know. How can I ever bring myself to leave her?\r\n",

      "On reaching the third storey of the hotel I experienced a shock. I was\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "But she had vanished again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Aha! So the two were carrying on a correspondence! However, I set off\r\n",
      "to search for Astley--first at his hotel, and then at the Casino, where\r\n",
      "I went the round of the salons in vain. At length, vexed, and almost in\r\n",
      "despair, I was on my way home when I ran across him among a troop of\r\n",
      "English ladies and gentlemen who had been out for a ride. Beckoning to\r\n",

      "correspondence was about. To think that HE should be her confidant! \"My\r\n",

      "General. When I entered his study I was feeling anything but kindly\r\n",
      "disposed. I found there the General himself, De Griers, and Mlle.\r\n",
      "Blanche, but not Mlle.'s mother, who was a person whom her reputed\r\n",
      "daughter used only for show purposes, since in all matters of business\r\n",
      "the daughter fended for herself, and it is unlikely that the mother\r\n",
      "knew anything about them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Some very heated discussion was in progress, and meanwhile the door of\r\n",
      "the study was open--an unprecedented circumstance. As I approached the\r\n",
      "portals I could hear loud voices raised, for mingled with the pert,\r\n",
      "venomous accents of De Griers were Mlle. Blanche's excited, impudently\r\n",
      "abusive tongue and the General's plaintive wail as, apparently, he\r\n",
      "sought to justify himself in something. But on my appearance every one\r\n",
      "stopped speaking, and tried to put a better face upon matters. De\r\n",
      "Griers smoothed his hair, and twisted his angry face into a smile--into\r\n",
      "the mean, studiedly polite French smile which I so detested; while the\r\n",
      "downcast, perplexed General assumed an air of dignity--though only in a\r\n",
      "mechanical way. On the other hand, Mlle. Blanche did not trouble to\r\n",
      "conceal the wrath that was sparkling in her countenance, but bent her\r\n",
      "gaze upon me with an air of impatient expectancy. I may remark that\r\n",
      "hitherto she had treated me with absolute superciliousness, and, so far\r\n",
      "from answering my salutations, had always ignored them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Alexis Ivanovitch,\" began the General in a tone of affectionate\r\n",
      "upbraiding, \"may I say to you that I find it strange, exceedingly\r\n",
      "strange, that--In short, your conduct towards myself and my family-- In\r\n",
      "a word, your--er--extremely--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Eh! Ce n'est pas ca,\" interrupted De Griers in a tone of impatience\r\n",
      "and contempt (evidently he was the ruling spirit of the conclave). \"Mon\r\n",
      "cher monsieur, notre general se trompe. What he means to say is that he\r\n",
      "warns you--he begs of you most earnestly--not to ruin him. I use the\r\n",
      "expression because--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why? Why?\" I interjected.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Because you have taken upon yourself to act as guide to this, to\r\n",
      "this--how shall I express it?--to this old lady, a cette pauvre\r\n",
      "terrible vieille. But she will only gamble away all that she\r\n",
      "has--gamble it away like thistledown. You yourself have seen her play.\r\n",
      "Once she has acquired the taste for gambling, she will never leave the\r\n",
      "roulette-table, but, of sheer perversity and temper, will stake her\r\n",
      "all, and lose it. In cases such as hers a gambler can never be torn\r\n",
      "away from the game; and then--and then--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And then,\" asseverated the General, \"you will have ruined my whole\r\n",
      "family. I and my family are her heirs, for she has no nearer relatives\r\n",
      "than ourselves. I tell you frankly that my affairs are in great--very\r\n",
      "great disorder; how much they are so you yourself are partially aware.\r\n",
      "If she should lose a large sum, or, maybe, her whole fortune, what will\r\n",
      "become of us--of my children\" (here the General exchanged a glance with\r\n",
      "De Griers) \"or of me?\" (here he looked at Mlle. Blanche, who turned her\r\n",
      "head contemptuously away). \"Alexis Ivanovitch, I beg of you to save us.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Tell me, General, how am I to do so? On what footing do I stand here?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Refuse to take her about. Simply leave her alone.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But she would soon find some one else to take my place?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ce n'est pas ca, ce n'est pas ca,\" again interrupted De Griers. \"Que\r\n",
      "diable! Do not leave her alone so much as advise her, persuade her,\r\n",
      "draw her away. In any case do not let her gamble; find her some\r\n",
      "counter-attraction.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And how am I to do that? If only you would undertake the task,\r\n",
      "Monsieur de Griers!\" I said this last as innocently as possible, but at\r\n",
      "once saw a rapid glance of excited interrogation pass from Mlle.\r\n",
      "Blanche to De Griers, while in the face of the latter also there\r\n",
      "gleamed something which he could not repress.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, at the present moment she would refuse to accept my services,\"\r\n",
      "said he with a gesture. \"But if, later--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Here he gave Mlle. Blanche another glance which was full of meaning;\r\n",
      "whereupon she advanced towards me with a bewitching smile, and seized\r\n",
      "and pressed my hands. Devil take it, but how that devilish visage of\r\n",
      "hers could change! At the present moment it was a visage full of\r\n",
      "supplication, and as gentle in its expression as that of a smiling,\r\n",
      "roguish infant. Stealthily, she drew me apart from the rest as though\r\n",
      "the more completely to separate me from them; and, though no harm came\r\n",
      "of her doing so--for it was merely a stupid manoeuvre, and no more--I\r\n",
      "found the situation very unpleasant.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The General hastened to lend her his support.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Alexis Ivanovitch,\" he began, \"pray pardon me for having said what I\r\n",
      "did just now--for having said more than I meant to do. I beg and\r\n",
      "beseech you, I kiss the hem of your garment, as our Russian saying has\r\n",
      "it, for you, and only you, can save us. I and Mlle. de Cominges, we all\r\n",
      "of us beg of you--But you understand, do you not? Surely you\r\n",
      "understand?\" and with his eyes he indicated Mlle. Blanche. Truly he was\r\n",
      "cutting a pitiful figure!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At this moment three low, respectful knocks sounded at the door; which,\r\n",
      "on being opened, revealed a chambermaid, with Potapitch behind\r\n",
      "her--come from the Grandmother to request that I should attend her in\r\n",
      "her rooms. \"She is in a bad humour,\" added Potapitch.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The time was half-past three.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My mistress was unable to sleep,\" explained Potapitch; \"so, after\r\n",
      "tossing about for a while, she suddenly rose, called for her chair, and\r\n",
      "sent me to look for you. She is now in the verandah.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Quelle megere!\" exclaimed De Griers.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "True enough, I found Madame in the hotel verandah--much put about at my\r\n",
      "delay, for she had been unable to contain herself until four o'clock.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Lift me up,\" she cried to the bearers, and once more we set out for\r\n",
      "the roulette-salons.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "XII\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Grandmother was in an impatient, irritable frame of mind. Without\r\n",
      "doubt the roulette had turned her head, for she appeared to be\r\n",
      "indifferent to everything else, and, in general, seemed much\r\n",
      "distraught. For instance, she asked me no questions about objects en\r\n",
      "route, except that, when a sumptuous barouche passed us and raised a\r\n",
      "cloud of dust, she lifted her hand for a moment, and inquired, \"What\r\n",
      "was that?\" Yet even then she did not appear to hear my reply, although\r\n",
      "at times her abstraction was interrupted by sallies and fits of sharp,\r\n",
      "impatient fidgeting. Again, when I pointed out to her the Baron and\r\n",
      "Baroness Burmergelm walking to the Casino, she merely looked at them in\r\n",
      "an absent-minded sort of way, and said with complete indifference,\r\n",
      "\"Ah!\" Then, turning sharply to Potapitch and Martha, who were walking\r\n",
      "behind us, she rapped out:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why have YOU attached yourselves to the party? We are not going to\r\n",
      "take you with us every time. Go home at once.\" Then, when the servants\r\n",
      "had pulled hasty bows and departed, she added to me: \"You are all the\r\n",
      "escort I need.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At the Casino the Grandmother seemed to be expected, for no time was\r\n",
      "lost in procuring her former place beside the croupier. It is my\r\n",
      "opinion that though croupiers seem such ordinary, humdrum\r\n",
      "officials--men who care nothing whether the bank wins or loses--they\r\n",
      "are, in reality, anything but indifferent to the bank's losing, and are\r\n",
      "given instructions to attract players, and to keep a watch over the\r\n",
      "bank's interests; as also, that for such services, these officials are\r\n",
      "awarded prizes and premiums. At all events, the croupiers of\r\n",
      "Roulettenberg seemed to look upon the Grandmother as their lawful\r\n",
      "prey--whereafter there befell what our party had foretold.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It happened thus:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As soon as ever we arrived the Grandmother ordered me to stake twelve\r\n",
      "ten-gulden pieces in succession upon zero. Once, twice, and thrice I\r\n",
      "did so, yet zero never turned up.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Stake again,\" said the old lady with an impatient nudge of my elbow,\r\n",
      "and I obeyed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"How many times have we lost?\" she inquired--actually grinding her\r\n",
      "teeth in her excitement.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"We have lost 144 ten-gulden pieces,\" I replied. \"I tell you, Madame,\r\n",
      "that zero may not turn up until nightfall.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Never mind,\" she interrupted. \"Keep on staking upon zero, and also\r\n",
      "stake a thousand gulden upon rouge. Here is a banknote with which to do\r\n",
      "so.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The red turned up, but zero missed again, and we only got our thousand\r\n",
      "gulden back.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But you see, you see,\" whispered the old lady. \"We have now recovered\r\n",
      "almost all that we staked. Try zero again. Let us do so another ten\r\n",
      "times, and then leave off.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "By the fifth round, however, the Grandmother was weary of the scheme.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"To the devil with that zero!\" she exclaimed. \"Stake four thousand\r\n",
      "gulden upon the red.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But, Madame, that will be so much to venture!\" I remonstrated.\r\n",
      "\"Suppose the red should not turn up?\" The Grandmother almost struck me\r\n",
      "in her excitement. Her agitation was rapidly making her quarrelsome.\r\n",
      "Consequently, there was nothing for it but to stake the whole four\r\n",
      "thousand gulden as she had directed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The wheel revolved while the Grandmother sat as bolt upright, and with\r\n",
      "as proud and quiet a mien, as though she had not the least doubt of\r\n",
      "winning.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Zero!\" cried the croupier.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At first the old lady failed to understand the situation; but, as soon\r\n",
      "as she saw the croupier raking in her four thousand gulden, together\r\n",
      "with everything else that happened to be lying on the table, and\r\n",
      "recognised that the zero which had been so long turning up, and on\r\n",
      "which we had lost nearly two hundred ten-gulden pieces, had at length,\r\n",
      "as though of set purpose, made a sudden reappearance--why, the poor old\r\n",
      "lady fell to cursing it, and to throwing herself about, and wailing and\r\n",
      "gesticulating at the company at large. Indeed, some people in our\r\n",
      "vicinity actually burst out laughing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"To think that that accursed zero should have turned up NOW!\" she\r\n",
      "sobbed. \"The accursed, accursed thing! And, it is all YOUR fault,\" she\r\n",
      "added, rounding upon me in a frenzy. \"It was you who persuaded me to\r\n",
      "cease staking upon it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But, Madame, I only explained the game to you. How am I to answer for\r\n",
      "every mischance which may occur in it?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You and your mischances!\" she whispered threateningly. \"Go! Away at\r\n",
      "once!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Farewell, then, Madame.\" And I turned to depart.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No--stay,\" she put in hastily. \"Where are you going to? Why should you\r\n",
      "leave me? You fool! No, no... stay here. It is I who was the fool. Tell\r\n",
      "me what I ought to do.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I cannot take it upon myself to advise you, for you will only blame me\r\n",
      "if I do so. Play at your own discretion. Say exactly what you wish\r\n",
      "staked, and I will stake it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Very well. Stake another four thousand gulden upon the red. Take this\r\n",
      "banknote to do it with. I have still got twenty thousand roubles in\r\n",
      "actual cash.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But,\" I whispered, \"such a quantity of money--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Never mind. I cannot rest until I have won back my losses. Stake!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I staked, and we lost.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Stake again, stake again--eight thousand at a stroke!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I cannot, Madame. The largest stake allowed is four thousand gulden.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, then; stake four thousand.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This time we won, and the Grandmother recovered herself a little.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You see, you see!\" she exclaimed as she nudged me. \"Stake another four\r\n",
      "thousand.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I did so, and lost. Again, and yet again, we lost. \"Madame, your twelve\r\n",
      "thousand gulden are now gone,\" at length I reported.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I see they are,\" she replied with, as it were, the calmness of\r\n",
      "despair. \"I see they are,\" she muttered again as she gazed straight in\r\n",
      "front of her, like a person lost in thought. \"Ah well, I do not mean to\r\n",
      "rest until I have staked another four thousand.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But you have no money with which to do it, Madame. In this satchel I\r\n",
      "can see only a few five percent bonds and some transfers--no actual\r\n",
      "cash.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And in the purse?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"A mere trifle.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But there is a money-changer's office here, is there not? They told me\r\n",
      "I should be able to get any sort of paper security changed!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Quite so; to any amount you please. But you will lose on the\r\n",
      "transaction what would frighten even a Jew.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Rubbish! I am DETERMINED to retrieve my losses. Take me away, and call\r\n",
      "those fools of bearers.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I wheeled the chair out of the throng, and, the bearers making their\r\n",
      "appearance, we left the Casino.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Hurry, hurry!\" commanded the Grandmother. \"Show me the nearest way to\r\n",
      "the money-changer's. Is it far?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"A couple of steps, Madame.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At the turning from the square into the Avenue we came face to face\r\n",
      "with the whole of our party--the General, De Griers, Mlle. Blanche, and\r\n",
      "her mother. Only Polina and Mr. Astley were absent.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, well, well!\" exclaimed the Grandmother. \"But we have no time to\r\n",
      "stop. What do you want? I can't talk to you here.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I dropped behind a little, and immediately was pounced upon by De\r\n",
      "Griers.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She has lost this morning's winnings,\" I whispered, \"and also twelve\r\n",

      "going to get some bonds changed.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "De Griers stamped his foot with vexation, and hastened to communicate\r\n",
      "the tidings to the General. Meanwhile we continued to wheel the old\r\n",
      "lady along.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Stop her, stop her,\" whispered the General in consternation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You had better try and stop her yourself,\" I returned--also in a\r\n",
      "whisper.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My good mother,\" he said as he approached her, \"--my good mother, pray\r\n",
      "let, let--\" (his voice was beginning to tremble and sink) \"--let us\r\n",
      "hire a carriage, and go for a drive. Near here there is an enchanting\r\n",

      "see it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Begone with you and your views!\" said the Grandmother angrily as she\r\n",
      "waved him away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And there are trees there, and we could have tea under them,\"\r\n",

      "bourgeois--his whole outlook upon \"la nature et la verite\"!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Have done with you and your milk!\" cried the old lady. \"Go and stuff\r\n",
      "YOURSELF as much as you like, but my stomach simply recoils from the\r\n",
      "idea. What are you stopping for? I have nothing to say to you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Here we are, Madame,\" I announced. \"Here is the moneychanger's office.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I entered to get the securities changed, while the Grandmother remained\r\n",
      "outside in the porch, and the rest waited at a little distance, in\r\n",
      "doubt as to their best course of action. At length the old lady turned\r\n",
      "such an angry stare upon them that they departed along the road towards\r\n",
      "the Casino.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The process of changing involved complicated calculations which soon\r\n",
      "necessitated my return to the Grandmother for instructions.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The thieves!\" she exclaimed as she clapped her hands together. \"Never\r\n",
      "mind, though. Get the documents cashed--No; send the banker out to me,\"\r\n",
      "she added as an afterthought.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Would one of the clerks do, Madame?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, one of the clerks. The thieves!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The clerk consented to come out when he perceived that he was being\r\n",
      "asked for by an old lady who was too infirm to walk; after which the\r\n",
      "Grandmother began to upbraid him at length, and with great vehemence,\r\n",
      "for his alleged usuriousness, and to bargain with him in a mixture of\r\n",
      "Russian, French, and German--I acting as interpreter. Meanwhile, the\r\n",
      "grave-faced official eyed us both, and silently nodded his head. At the\r\n",
      "Grandmother, in particular, he gazed with a curiosity which almost\r\n",
      "bordered upon rudeness. At length, too, he smiled.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Pray recollect yourself!\" cried the old lady. \"And may my money choke\r\n",
      "you! Alexis Ivanovitch, tell him that we can easily repair to someone\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Of what the ultimate calculations consisted I do not exactly remember,\r\n",
      "but at all events they were alarming. Receiving twelve thousand florins\r\n",
      "in gold, I took also the statement of accounts, and carried it out to\r\n",
      "the Grandmother.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, well,\" she said, \"I am no accountant. Let us hurry away, hurry\r\n",
      "away.\" And she waved the paper aside.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Neither upon that accursed zero, however, nor upon that equally\r\n",
      "accursed red do I mean to stake a cent,\" I muttered to myself as I\r\n",
      "entered the Casino.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This time I did all I could to persuade the old lady to stake as little\r\n",
      "as possible--saying that a turn would come in the chances when she\r\n",
      "would be at liberty to stake more. But she was so impatient that,\r\n",
      "though at first she agreed to do as I suggested, nothing could stop her\r\n",
      "when once she had begun. By way of prelude she won stakes of a hundred\r\n",
      "and two hundred gulden.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"There you are!\" she said as she nudged me. \"See what we have won!\r\n",
      "Surely it would be worth our while to stake four thousand instead of a\r\n",
      "hundred, for we might win another four thousand, and then--! Oh, it was\r\n",
      "YOUR fault before--all your fault!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I felt greatly put out as I watched her play, but I decided to hold my\r\n",
      "tongue, and to give her no more advice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Suddenly De Griers appeared on the scene. It seemed that all this while\r\n",
      "he and his companions had been standing beside us--though I noticed\r\n",
      "that Mlle. Blanche had withdrawn a little from the rest, and was\r\n",
      "engaged in flirting with the Prince. Clearly the General was greatly\r\n",
      "put out at this. Indeed, he was in a perfect agony of vexation. But\r\n",
      "Mlle. was careful never to look his way, though he did his best to\r\n",
      "attract her notice. Poor General! By turns his face blanched and\r\n",
      "reddened, and he was trembling to such an extent that he could scarcely\r\n",
      "follow the old lady's play. At length Mlle. and the Prince took their\r\n",
      "departure, and the General followed them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Madame, Madame,\" sounded the honeyed accents of De Griers as he leant\r\n",
      "over to whisper in the Grandmother's ear. \"That stake will never win.\r\n",
      "No, no, it is impossible,\" he added in Russian with a writhe. \"No, no!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But why not?\" asked the Grandmother, turning round. \"Show me what I\r\n",
      "ought to do.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Instantly De Griers burst into a babble of French as he advised, jumped\r\n",
      "about, declared that such and such chances ought to be waited for, and\r\n",
      "started to make calculations of figures. All this he addressed to me in\r\n",
      "my capacity as translator--tapping the table the while with his finger,\r\n",
      "and pointing hither and thither. At length he seized a pencil, and\r\n",
      "began to reckon sums on paper until he had exhausted the Grandmother's\r\n",
      "patience.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Away with you!\" she interrupted. \"You talk sheer nonsense, for, though\r\n",
      "you keep on saying 'Madame, Madame,' you haven't the least notion what\r\n",
      "ought to be done. Away with you, I say!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Mais, Madame,\" cooed De Griers--and straightway started afresh with\r\n",
      "his fussy instructions.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Stake just ONCE, as he advises,\" the Grandmother said to me, \"and then\r\n",
      "we shall see what we shall see. Of course, his stake MIGHT win.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As a matter of fact, De Grier's one object was to distract the old lady\r\n",
      "from staking large sums; wherefore, he now suggested to her that she\r\n",
      "should stake upon certain numbers, singly and in groups. Consequently,\r\n",
      "in accordance with his instructions, I staked a ten-gulden piece upon\r\n",
      "several odd numbers in the first twenty, and five ten-gulden pieces\r\n",
      "upon certain groups of numbers-groups of from twelve to eighteen, and\r\n",
      "from eighteen to twenty-four. The total staked amounted to 160 gulden.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The wheel revolved. \"Zero!\" cried the croupier.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We had lost it all!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The fool!\" cried the old lady as she turned upon De Griers. \"You\r\n",
      "infernal Frenchman, to think that you should advise! Away with you!\r\n",
      "Though you fuss and fuss, you don't even know what you're talking\r\n",
      "about.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Deeply offended, De Griers shrugged his shoulders, favoured the\r\n",
      "Grandmother with a look of contempt, and departed. For some time past\r\n",
      "he had been feeling ashamed of being seen in such company, and this had\r\n",
      "proved the last straw.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "An hour later we had lost everything in hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Home!\" cried the Grandmother.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Not until we had turned into the Avenue did she utter a word; but from\r\n",
      "that point onwards, until we arrived at the hotel, she kept venting\r\n",
      "exclamations of \"What a fool I am! What a silly old fool I am, to be\r\n",
      "sure!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Arrived at the hotel, she called for tea, and then gave orders for her\r\n",
      "luggage to be packed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"We are off again,\" she announced.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But whither, Madame?\" inquired Martha.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What business is that of YOURS? Let the cricket stick to its hearth.\r\n",
      "[The Russian form of \"Mind your own business.\"] Potapitch, have\r\n",
      "everything packed, for we are returning to Moscow at once. I have\r\n",
      "fooled away fifteen thousand roubles.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Fifteen thousand roubles, good mistress? My God!\" And Potapitch spat\r\n",
      "upon his hands--probably to show that he was ready to serve her in any\r\n",
      "way he could.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Now then, you fool! At once you begin with your weeping and wailing!\r\n",
      "Be quiet, and pack. Also, run downstairs, and get my hotel bill.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The next train leaves at 9:30, Madame,\" I interposed, with a view to\r\n",
      "checking her agitation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And what is the time now?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Half-past eight.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"How vexing! But, never mind. Alexis Ivanovitch, I have not a kopeck\r\n",
      "left; I have but these two bank notes. Please run to the office and get\r\n",
      "them changed. Otherwise I shall have nothing to travel with.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Departing on her errand, I returned half an hour later to find the\r\n",
      "whole party gathered in her rooms. It appeared that the news of her\r\n",
      "impending departure for Moscow had thrown the conspirators into\r\n",
      "consternation even greater than her losses had done. For, said they,\r\n",
      "even if her departure should save her fortune, what will become of the\r\n",
      "General later? And who is to repay De Griers? Clearly Mlle. Blanche\r\n",
      "would never consent to wait until the Grandmother was dead, but would\r\n",
      "at once elope with the Prince or someone else. So they had all gathered\r\n",
      "together--endeavouring to calm and dissuade the Grandmother. Only\r\n",
      "Polina was absent. For her part the Grandmother had nothing for the\r\n",
      "party but abuse.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Away with you, you rascals!\" she was shouting. \"What have my affairs\r\n",
      "to do with you? Why, in particular, do you\"--here she indicated De\r\n",
      "Griers--\"come sneaking here with your goat's beard? And what do\r\n",
      "YOU\"--here she turned to Mlle. Blanche \"want of me? What are YOU\r\n",
      "finicking for?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Diantre!\" muttered Mlle. under her breath, but her eyes were flashing.\r\n",
      "Then all at once she burst into a laugh and left the room--crying to\r\n",
      "the General as she did so: \"Elle vivra cent ans!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"So you have been counting upon my death, have you?\" fumed the old\r\n",
      "lady. \"Away with you! Clear them out of the room, Alexis Ivanovitch.\r\n",
      "What business is it of THEIRS? It is not THEIR money that I have been\r\n",
      "squandering, but my own.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The General shrugged his shoulders, bowed, and withdrew, with De Griers\r\n",
      "behind him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Call Prascovia,\" commanded the Grandmother, and in five minutes Martha\r\n",
      "reappeared with Polina, who had been sitting with the children in her\r\n",
      "own room (having purposely determined not to leave it that day). Her\r\n",
      "face looked grave and careworn.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Prascovia,\" began the Grandmother, \"is what I have just heard through\r\n",
      "a side wind true--namely, that this fool of a stepfather of yours is\r\n",
      "going to marry that silly whirligig of a Frenchwoman--that actress, or\r\n",
      "something worse? Tell me, is it true?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I do not know FOR CERTAIN, Grandmamma,\" replied Polina; \"but from\r\n",
      "Mlle. Blanche's account (for she does not appear to think it necessary\r\n",
      "to conceal anything) I conclude that--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You need not say any more,\" interrupted the Grandmother energetically.\r\n",
      "\"I understand the situation. I always thought we should get something\r\n",
      "like this from him, for I always looked upon him as a futile, frivolous\r\n",
      "fellow who gave himself unconscionable airs on the fact of his being a\r\n",
      "general (though he only became one because he retired as a colonel).\r\n",
      "Yes, I know all about the sending of the telegrams to inquire whether\r\n",
      "'the old woman is likely to turn up her toes soon.' Ah, they were\r\n",
      "looking for the legacies! Without money that wretched woman (what is\r\n",
      "her name?--Oh, De Cominges) would never dream of accepting the General\r\n",
      "and his false teeth--no, not even for him to be her lacquey--since she\r\n",
      "herself, they say, possesses a pile of money, and lends it on interest,\r\n",
      "and makes a good thing out of it. However, it is not you, Prascovia,\r\n",
      "that I am blaming; it was not you who sent those telegrams. Nor, for\r\n",
      "that matter, do I wish to recall old scores. True, I know that you are\r\n",
      "a vixen by nature--that you are a wasp which will sting one if one\r\n",
      "touches it--yet, my heart is sore for you, for I loved your mother,\r\n",
      "Katerina. Now, will you leave everything here, and come away with me?\r\n",
      "Otherwise, I do not know what is to become of you, and it is not right\r\n",
      "that you should continue living with these people. Nay,\" she\r\n",
      "interposed, the moment that Polina attempted to speak, \"I have not yet\r\n",
      "finished. I ask of you nothing in return. My house in Moscow is, as you\r\n",
      "know, large enough for a palace, and you could occupy a whole floor of\r\n",
      "it if you liked, and keep away from me for weeks together. Will you\r\n",
      "come with me or will you not?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"First of all, let me ask of YOU,\" replied Polina, \"whether you are\r\n",
      "intending to depart at once?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What? You suppose me to be jesting? I have said that I am going, and I\r\n",
      "AM going. Today I have squandered fifteen thousand roubles at that\r\n",
      "accursed roulette of yours, and though, five years ago, I promised the\r\n",
      "people of a certain suburb of Moscow to build them a stone church in\r\n",
      "place of a wooden one, I have been fooling away my money here! However,\r\n",
      "I am going back now to build my church.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But what about the waters, Grandmamma? Surely you came here to take\r\n",
      "the waters?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You and your waters! Do not anger me, Prascovia. Surely you are trying\r\n",
      "to? Say, then: will you, or will you not, come with me?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Grandmamma,\" Polina replied with deep feeling, \"I am very, very\r\n",
      "grateful to you for the shelter which you have so kindly offered me.\r\n",
      "Also, to a certain extent you have guessed my position aright, and I am\r\n",
      "beholden to you to such an extent that it may be that I will come and\r\n",
      "live with you, and that very soon; yet there are important reasons\r\n",
      "why--why I cannot make up my mind just yet. If you would let me have,\r\n",
      "say, a couple of weeks to decide in--?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You mean that you are NOT coming?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I mean only that I cannot come just yet. At all events, I could not\r\n",
      "well leave my little brother and sister here, since, since--if I were\r\n",
      "to leave them--they would be abandoned altogether. But if, Grandmamma,\r\n",
      "you would take the little ones AND myself, then, of course, I could\r\n",
      "come with you, and would do all I could to serve you\" (this she said\r\n",
      "with great earnestness). \"Only, without the little ones I CANNOT come.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do not make a fuss\" (as a matter of fact Polina never at any time\r\n",
      "either fussed or wept). \"The Great Foster--Father [Translated\r\n",
      "literally--The Great Poulterer] can find for all his chicks a place.\r\n",
      "You are not coming without the children? But see here, Prascovia. I\r\n",
      "wish you well, and nothing but well: yet I have divined the reason why\r\n",
      "you will not come. Yes, I know all, Prascovia. That Frenchman will\r\n",
      "never bring you good of any sort.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Polina coloured hotly, and even I started. \"For,\" thought I to myself,\r\n",
      "\"every one seems to know about that affair. Or perhaps I am the only\r\n",
      "one who does not know about it?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Now, now! Do not frown,\" continued the Grandmother. \"But I do not\r\n",
      "intend to slur things over. You will take care that no harm befalls\r\n",
      "you, will you not? For you are a girl of sense, and I am sorry for\r\n",
      "you--I regard you in a different light to the rest of them. And now,\r\n",
      "please, leave me. Good-bye.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But let me stay with you a little longer,\" said Polina.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No,\" replied the other; \"you need not. Do not bother me, for you and\r\n",
      "all of them have tired me out.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Yet when Polina tried to kiss the Grandmother's hand, the old lady\r\n",
      "withdrew it, and herself kissed the girl on the cheek. As she passed\r\n",
      "me, Polina gave me a momentary glance, and then as swiftly averted her\r\n",
      "eyes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And good-bye to you, also, Alexis Ivanovitch. The train starts in an\r\n",
      "hour's time, and I think that you must be weary of me. Take these five\r\n",
      "hundred gulden for yourself.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I thank you humbly, Madame, but I am ashamed to--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Come, come!\" cried the Grandmother so energetically, and with such an\r\n",
      "air of menace, that I did not dare refuse the money further.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"If, when in Moscow, you have no place where you can lay your head,\"\r\n",
      "she added, \"come and see me, and I will give you a recommendation. Now,\r\n",
      "Potapitch, get things ready.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I ascended to my room, and lay down upon the bed. A whole hour I must\r\n",
      "have lain thus, with my head resting upon my hand. So the crisis had\r\n",
      "come! I needed time for its consideration. To-morrow I would have a\r\n",
      "talk with Polina. Ah! The Frenchman! So, it was true? But how could it\r\n",
      "be so? Polina and De Griers! What a combination!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "No, it was too improbable. Suddenly I leapt up with the idea of seeking\r\n",
      "Astley and forcing him to speak. There could be no doubt that he knew\r\n",
      "more than I did. Astley? Well, he was another problem for me to solve.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Suddenly there came a knock at the door, and I opened it to find\r\n",
      "Potapitch awaiting me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Sir,\" he said, \"my mistress is asking for you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Indeed? But she is just departing, is she not? The train leaves in ten\r\n",
      "minutes' time.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She is uneasy, sir; she cannot rest. Come quickly, sir; do not delay.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I ran downstairs at once. The Grandmother was just being carried out of\r\n",
      "her rooms into the corridor. In her hands she held a roll of bank-notes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Alexis Ivanovitch,\" she cried, \"walk on ahead, and we will set out\r\n",

      "long before I had made up my mind.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"With your leave, Madame,\" I said, \"I will not go with you.\"\r\n",

      "good-for-nothing?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Pardon me, but I have nothing to reproach myself with. I merely will\r\n",
      "not go. I merely intend neither to witness nor to join in your play. I\r\n",
      "also beg to return you your five hundred gulden. Farewell.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Laying the money upon a little table which the Grandmother's chair\r\n",
      "happened to be passing, I bowed and withdrew.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What folly!\" the Grandmother shouted after me. \"Very well, then. Do\r\n",
      "not come, and I will find my way alone. Potapitch, you must come with\r\n",
      "me. Lift up the chair, and carry me along.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I failed to find Mr. Astley, and returned home. It was now growing\r\n",
      "late--it was past midnight, but I subsequently learnt from Potapitch\r\n",
      "how the Grandmother's day had ended. She had lost all the money which,\r\n",
      "earlier in the day, I had got for her paper securities--a sum amounting\r\n",
      "to about ten thousand roubles. This she did under the direction of the\r\n",
      "Pole whom, that afternoon, she had dowered with two ten-gulden pieces.\r\n",
      "But before his arrival on the scene, she had commanded Potapitch to\r\n",
      "stake for her; until at length she had told him also to go about his\r\n",
      "business. Upon that the Pole had leapt into the breach. Not only did it\r\n",
      "happen that he knew the Russian language, but also he could speak a\r\n",
      "mixture of three different dialects, so that the pair were able to\r\n",
      "understand one another. Yet the old lady never ceased to abuse him,\r\n",
      "despite his deferential manner, and to compare him unfavourably with\r\n",
      "myself (so, at all events, Potapitch declared). \"You,\" the old\r\n",
      "chamberlain said to me, \"treated her as a gentleman should, but he--he\r\n",
      "robbed her right and left, as I could see with my own eyes. Twice she\r\n",
      "caught him at it, and rated him soundly. On one occasion she even\r\n",
      "pulled his hair, so that the bystanders burst out laughing. Yet she\r\n",
      "lost everything, sir--that is to say, she lost all that you had changed\r\n",
      "for her. Then we brought her home, and, after asking for some water and\r\n",
      "saying her prayers, she went to bed. So worn out was she that she fell\r\n",

      "I began under the influence of impressions at once poignant and\r\n",
      "disordered. The crisis which I then felt to be approaching has now\r\n",
      "arrived, but in a form a hundred times more extensive and unexpected\r\n",
      "than I had looked for. To me it all seems strange, uncouth, and tragic.\r\n",
      "Certain occurrences have befallen me which border upon the marvellous.\r\n",
      "At all events, that is how I view them. I view them so in one regard at\r\n",
      "least. I refer to the whirlpool of events in which, at the time, I was\r\n",
      "revolving. But the most curious feature of all is my relation to those\r\n",
      "events, for hitherto I had never clearly understood myself. Yet now the\r\n",
      "actual crisis has passed away like a dream. Even my passion for Polina\r\n",
      "is dead. Was it ever so strong and genuine as I thought? If so, what\r\n",
      "has become of it now? At times I fancy that I must be mad; that\r\n",
      "somewhere I am sitting in a madhouse; that these events have merely\r\n",
      "SEEMED to happen; that still they merely SEEM to be happening.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I have been arranging and re-perusing my notes (perhaps for the purpose\r\n",
      "of convincing myself that I am not in a madhouse). At present I am\r\n",
      "lonely and alone. Autumn is coming--already it is mellowing the leaves;\r\n",
      "and, as I sit brooding in this melancholy little town (and how\r\n",
      "melancholy the little towns of Germany can be!), I find myself taking\r\n",
      "no thought for the future, but living under the influence of passing\r\n",
      "moods, and of my recollections of the tempest which recently drew me\r\n",
      "into its vortex, and then cast me out again. At times I seem still to\r\n",
      "be caught within that vortex. At times, the tempest seems once more to\r\n",
      "be gathering, and, as it passes overhead, to be wrapping me in its\r\n",
      "folds, until I have lost my sense of order and reality, and continue\r\n",
      "whirling and whirling and whirling around.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Yet, it may be that I shall be able to stop myself from revolving if\r\n",
      "once I can succeed in rendering myself an exact account of what has\r\n",
      "happened within the month just past. Somehow I feel drawn towards the\r\n",
      "pen; on many and many an evening I have had nothing else in the world\r\n",
      "to do. But, curiously enough, of late I have taken to amusing myself\r\n",
      "with the works of M. Paul de Kock, which I read in German translations\r\n",
      "obtained from a wretched local library. These works I cannot abide, yet\r\n",
      "I read them, and find myself marvelling that I should be doing so.\r\n",
      "Somehow I seem to be afraid of any SERIOUS book--afraid of permitting\r\n",
      "any SERIOUS preoccupation to break the spell of the passing moment. So\r\n",
      "dear to me is the formless dream of which I have spoken, so dear to me\r\n",
      "are the impressions which it has left behind it, that I fear to touch\r\n",
      "the vision with anything new, lest it should dissolve in smoke. But is\r\n",
      "it so dear to me? Yes, it IS dear to me, and will ever be fresh in my\r\n",
      "recollections--even forty years hence....\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So let me write of it, but only partially, and in a more abridged form\r\n",
      "than my full impressions might warrant.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "First of all, let me conclude the history of the Grandmother. Next day\r\n",
      "she lost every gulden that she possessed. Things were bound to happen\r\n",
      "so, for persons of her type who have once entered upon that road\r\n",
      "descend it with ever-increasing rapidity, even as a sledge descends a\r\n",
      "toboggan-slide. All day until eight o'clock that evening did she play;\r\n",
      "and, though I personally did not witness her exploits, I learnt of them\r\n",
      "later through report.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "All that day Potapitch remained in attendance upon her; but the Poles\r\n",
      "who directed her play she changed more than once. As a beginning she\r\n",
      "dismissed her Pole of the previous day--the Pole whose hair she had\r\n",
      "pulled--and took to herself another one; but the latter proved worse\r\n",
      "even than the former, and incurred dismissal in favour of the first\r\n",
      "Pole, who, during the time of his unemployment, had nevertheless\r\n",
      "hovered around the Grandmother's chair, and from time to time obtruded\r\n",
      "his head over her shoulder. At length the old lady became desperate,\r\n",
      "for the second Pole, when dismissed, imitated his predecessor by\r\n",
      "declining to go away; with the result that one Pole remained standing\r\n",
      "on the right of the victim, and the other on her left; from which\r\n",
      "vantage points the pair quarrelled, abused each other concerning the\r\n",
      "stakes and rounds, and exchanged the epithet \"laidak\" [Rascal] and\r\n",
      "other Polish terms of endearment. Finally, they effected a mutual\r\n",
      "reconciliation, and, tossing the money about anyhow, played simply at\r\n",
      "random. Once more quarrelling, each of them staked money on his own\r\n",
      "side of the Grandmother's chair (for instance, the one Pole staked upon\r\n",
      "the red, and the other one upon the black), until they had so confused\r\n",
      "and browbeaten the old lady that, nearly weeping, she was forced to\r\n",
      "appeal to the head croupier for protection, and to have the two Poles\r\n",
      "expelled. No time was lost in this being done, despite the rascals'\r\n",
      "cries and protestations that the old lady was in their debt, that she\r\n",
      "had cheated them, and that her general behaviour had been mean and\r\n",
      "dishonourable. The same evening the unfortunate Potapitch related the\r\n",
      "story to me with tears complaining that the two men had filled their\r\n",
      "pockets with money (he himself had seen them do it) which had been\r\n",
      "shamelessly pilfered from his mistress. For instance, one Pole demanded\r\n",
      "of the Grandmother fifty gulden for his trouble, and then staked the\r\n",
      "money by the side of her stake. She happened to win; whereupon he cried\r\n",
      "out that the winning stake was his, and hers the loser. As soon as the\r\n",
      "two Poles had been expelled, Potapitch left the room, and reported to\r\n",
      "the authorities that the men's pockets were full of gold; and, on the\r\n",
      "Grandmother also requesting the head croupier to look into the affair,\r\n",
      "the police made their appearance, and, despite the protests of the\r\n",
      "Poles (who, indeed, had been caught redhanded), their pockets were\r\n",
      "turned inside out, and the contents handed over to the Grandmother. In\r\n",
      "fact, in, view of the circumstance that she lost all day, the croupiers\r\n",
      "and other authorities of the Casino showed her every attention; and on\r\n",
      "her fame spreading through the town, visitors of every\r\n",
      "nationality--even the most knowing of them, the most\r\n",
      "distinguished--crowded to get a glimpse of \"la vieille comtesse russe,\r\n",
      "tombee en enfance,\" who had lost \"so many millions.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Yet with the money which the authorities restored to her from the\r\n",
      "pockets of the Poles the Grandmother effected very, very little, for\r\n",
      "there soon arrived to take his countrymen's place, a third Pole--a man\r\n",
      "who could speak Russian fluently, was dressed like a gentleman (albeit\r\n",
      "in lacqueyish fashion), and sported a huge moustache. Though polite\r\n",
      "enough to the old lady, he took a high hand with the bystanders. In\r\n",
      "short, he offered himself less as a servant than as an ENTERTAINER.\r\n",
      "After each round he would turn to the old lady, and swear terrible\r\n",
      "oaths to the effect that he was a \"Polish gentleman of honour\" who\r\n",
      "would scorn to take a kopeck of her money; and, though he repeated\r\n",
      "these oaths so often that at length she grew alarmed, he had her play\r\n",
      "in hand, and began to win on her behalf; wherefore, she felt that she\r\n",
      "could not well get rid of him. An hour later the two Poles who, earlier\r\n",
      "in the day, had been expelled from the Casino, made a reappearance\r\n",
      "behind the old lady's chair, and renewed their offers of service--even\r\n",
      "if it were only to be sent on messages; but from Potapitch I\r\n",
      "subsequently had it that between these rascals and the said \"gentleman\r\n",
      "of honour\" there passed a wink, as well as that the latter put\r\n",
      "something into their hands. Next, since the Grandmother had not yet\r\n",
      "lunched--she had scarcely for a moment left her chair--one of the two\r\n",
      "Poles ran to the restaurant of the Casino, and brought her thence a cup\r\n",
      "of soup, and afterwards some tea. In fact, BOTH the Poles hastened to\r\n",
      "perform this office. Finally, towards the close of the day, when it was\r\n",
      "clear that the Grandmother was about to play her last bank-note, there\r\n",
      "could be seen standing behind her chair no fewer than six natives of\r\n",
      "Poland--persons who, as yet, had been neither audible nor visible; and\r\n",
      "as soon as ever the old lady played the note in question, they took no\r\n",
      "further notice of her, but pushed their way past her chair to the\r\n",
      "table; seized the money, and staked it--shouting and disputing the\r\n",
      "while, and arguing with the \"gentleman of honour\" (who also had\r\n",
      "forgotten the Grandmother's existence), as though he were their equal.\r\n",
      "Even when the Grandmother had lost her all, and was returning (about\r\n",
      "eight o'clock) to the hotel, some three or four Poles could not bring\r\n",
      "themselves to leave her, but went on running beside her chair and\r\n",
      "volubly protesting that the Grandmother had cheated them, and that she\r\n",
      "ought to be made to surrender what was not her own. Thus the party\r\n",
      "arrived at the hotel; whence, presently, the gang of rascals was\r\n",
      "ejected neck and crop.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "According to Potapitch's calculations, the Grandmother lost, that day,\r\n",
      "a total of ninety thousand roubles, in addition to the money which she\r\n",
      "had lost the day before. Every paper security which she had brought\r\n",
      "with her--five percent bonds, internal loan scrip, and what not--she\r\n",
      "had changed into cash. Also, I could not but marvel at the way in\r\n",
      "which, for seven or eight hours at a stretch, she sat in that chair of\r\n",
      "hers, almost never leaving the table. Again, Potapitch told me that\r\n",
      "there were three occasions on which she really began to win; but that,\r\n",
      "led on by false hopes, she was unable to tear herself away at the right\r\n",
      "moment. Every gambler knows how a person may sit a day and a night at\r\n",
      "cards without ever casting a glance to right or to left.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Meanwhile, that day some other very important events were passing in\r\n",
      "our hotel. As early as eleven o'clock--that is to say, before the\r\n",
      "Grandmother had quitted her rooms--the General and De Griers decided\r\n",
      "upon their last stroke. In other words, on learning that the old lady\r\n",
      "had changed her mind about departing, and was bent on setting out for\r\n",
      "the Casino again, the whole of our gang (Polina only excepted)\r\n",
      "proceeded en masse to her rooms, for the purpose of finally and frankly\r\n",
      "treating with her. But the General, quaking and greatly apprehensive as\r\n",
      "to his possible future, overdid things. After half an hour's prayers\r\n",
      "and entreaties, coupled with a full confession of his debts, and even\r\n",
      "of his passion for Mlle. Blanche (yes, he had quite lost his head), he\r\n",
      "suddenly adopted a tone of menace, and started to rage at the old\r\n",
      "lady--exclaiming that she was sullying the family honour, that she was\r\n",
      "making a public scandal of herself, and that she was smirching the fair\r\n",
      "name of Russia. The upshot was that the Grandmother turned him out of\r\n",
      "the room with her stick (it was a real stick, too!). Later in the\r\n",
      "morning he held several consultations with De Griers--the question\r\n",
      "which occupied him being: Is it in any way possible to make use of the\r\n",
      "police--to tell them that \"this respected, but unfortunate, old lady\r\n",
      "has gone out of her mind, and is squandering her last kopeck,\" or\r\n",
      "something of the kind? In short, is it in any way possible to engineer\r\n",
      "a species of supervision over, or of restraint upon, the old lady? De\r\n",
      "Griers, however, shrugged his shoulders at this, and laughed in the\r\n",
      "General's face, while the old warrior went on chattering volubly, and\r\n",
      "running up and down his study. Finally De Griers waved his hand, and\r\n",
      "disappeared from view; and by evening it became known that he had left\r\n",
      "the hotel, after holding a very secret and important conference with\r\n",
      "Mlle. Blanche. As for the latter, from early morning she had taken\r\n",
      "decisive measures, by completely excluding the General from her\r\n",
      "presence, and bestowing upon him not a glance. Indeed, even when the\r\n",
      "General pursued her to the Casino, and met her walking arm in arm with\r\n",
      "the Prince, he (the General) received from her and her mother not the\r\n",
      "slightest recognition. Nor did the Prince himself bow. The rest of the\r\n",
      "day Mlle. spent in probing the Prince, and trying to make him declare\r\n",
      "himself; but in this she made a woeful mistake. The little incident\r\n",
      "occurred in the evening. Suddenly Mlle. Blanche realised that the\r\n",
      "Prince had not even a copper to his name, but, on the contrary, was\r\n",
      "minded to borrow of her money wherewith to play at roulette. In high\r\n",
      "displeasure she drove him from her presence, and shut herself up in her\r\n",
      "room.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The same morning I went to see--or, rather, to look for--Mr. Astley,\r\n",
      "but was unsuccessful in my quest. Neither in his rooms nor in the\r\n",
      "Casino nor in the Park was he to be found; nor did he, that day, lunch\r\n",
      "at his hotel as usual. However, at about five o'clock I caught sight of\r\n",
      "him walking from the railway station to the Hotel d'Angleterre. He\r\n",
      "seemed to be in a great hurry and much preoccupied, though in his face\r\n",
      "I could discern no actual traces of worry or perturbation. He held out\r\n",
      "to me a friendly hand, with his usual ejaculation of \"Ah!\" but did not\r\n",
      "check his stride. I turned and walked beside him, but found, somehow,\r\n",
      "that his answers forbade any putting of definite questions. Moreover, I\r\n",
      "felt reluctant to speak to him of Polina; nor, for his part, did he ask\r\n",
      "me any questions concerning her, although, on my telling him of the\r\n",
      "Grandmother's exploits, he listened attentively and gravely, and then\r\n",
      "shrugged his shoulders.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She is gambling away everything that she has,\" I remarked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Indeed? She arrived at the Casino even before I had taken my departure\r\n",
      "by train, so I knew she had been playing. If I should have time I will\r\n",
      "go to the Casino to-night, and take a look at her. The thing interests\r\n",
      "me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Where have you been today?\" I asked--surprised at myself for having,\r\n",
      "as yet, omitted to put to him that question.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"To Frankfort.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"On business?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"On business.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "What more was there to be asked after that? I accompanied him until, as\r\n",
      "we drew level with the Hotel des Quatre Saisons, he suddenly nodded to\r\n",
      "me and disappeared. For myself, I returned home, and came to the\r\n",
      "conclusion that, even had I met him at two o'clock in the afternoon, I\r\n",
      "should have learnt no more from him than I had done at five o'clock,\r\n",
      "for the reason that I had no definite question to ask. It was bound to\r\n",
      "have been so. For me to formulate the query which I really wished to\r\n",
      "put was a simple impossibility.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Polina spent the whole of that day either in walking about the park\r\n",
      "with the nurse and children or in sitting in her own room. For a long\r\n",
      "while past she had avoided the General and had scarcely had a word to\r\n",
      "say to him (scarcely a word, I mean, on any SERIOUS topic). Yes, that I\r\n",
      "had noticed. Still, even though I was aware of the position in which\r\n",
      "the General was placed, it had never occurred to me that he would have\r\n",
      "any reason to avoid HER, or to trouble her with family explanations.\r\n",
      "Indeed, when I was returning to the hotel after my conversation with\r\n",
      "Astley, and chanced to meet Polina and the children, I could see that\r\n",
      "her face was as calm as though the family disturbances had never\r\n",
      "touched her. To my salute she responded with a slight bow, and I\r\n",
      "retired to my room in a very bad humour.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Of course, since the affair with the Burmergelms I had exchanged not a\r\n",
      "word with Polina, nor had with her any kind of intercourse. Yet I had\r\n",
      "been at my wits' end, for, as time went on, there was arising in me an\r\n",
      "ever-seething dissatisfaction. Even if she did not love me she ought\r\n",
      "not to have trampled upon my feelings, nor to have accepted my\r\n",
      "confessions with such contempt, seeing that she must have been aware\r\n",
      "that I loved her (of her own accord she had allowed me to tell her as\r\n",
      "much). Of course the situation between us had arisen in a curious\r\n",
      "manner. About two months ago, I had noticed that she had a desire to\r\n",
      "make me her friend, her confidant--that she was making trial of me for\r\n",
      "the purpose; but, for some reason or another, the desired result had\r\n",
      "never come about, and we had fallen into the present strange relations,\r\n",
      "which had led me to address her as I had done. At the same time, if my\r\n",
      "love was distasteful to her, why had she not FORBIDDEN me to speak of\r\n",
      "it to her?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But she had not so forbidden me. On the contrary, there had been\r\n",
      "occasions when she had even INVITED me to speak. Of course, this might\r\n",
      "have been done out of sheer wantonness, for I well knew--I had remarked\r\n",
      "it only too often--that, after listening to what I had to say, and\r\n",
      "angering me almost beyond endurance, she loved suddenly to torture me\r\n",
      "with some fresh outburst of contempt and aloofness! Yet she must have\r\n",
      "known that I could not live without her. Three days had elapsed since\r\n",
      "the affair with the Baron, and I could bear the severance no longer.\r\n",
      "When, that afternoon, I met her near the Casino, my heart almost made\r\n",
      "me faint, it beat so violently. She too could not live without me, for\r\n",
      "had she not said that she had NEED of me? Or had that too been spoken\r\n",
      "in jest?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That she had a secret of some kind there could be no doubt. What she\r\n",
      "had said to the Grandmother had stabbed me to the heart. On a thousand\r\n",
      "occasions I had challenged her to be open with me, nor could she have\r\n",
      "been ignorant that I was ready to give my very life for her. Yet always\r\n",
      "she had kept me at a distance with that contemptuous air of hers; or\r\n",
      "else she had demanded of me, in lieu of the life which I offered to lay\r\n",
      "at her feet, such escapades as I had perpetrated with the Baron. Ah,\r\n",
      "was it not torture to me, all this? For could it be that her whole\r\n",
      "world was bound up with the Frenchman? What, too, about Mr. Astley? The\r\n",
      "affair was inexplicable throughout. My God, what distress it caused me!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Arrived home, I, in a fit of frenzy, indited the following:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Polina Alexandrovna, I can see that there is approaching us an\r\n",
      "exposure which will involve you too. For the last time I ask of\r\n",
      "you--have you, or have you not, any need of my life? If you have, then\r\n",
      "make such dispositions as you wish, and I shall always be discoverable\r\n",
      "in my room if required. If you have need of my life, write or send for\r\n",
      "me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I sealed the letter, and dispatched it by the hand of a corridor\r\n",
      "lacquey, with orders to hand it to the addressee in person. Though I\r\n",
      "expected no answer, scarcely three minutes had elapsed before the\r\n",
      "lacquey returned with \"the compliments of a certain person.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Next, about seven o'clock, I was sent for by the General. I found him\r\n",
      "in his study, apparently preparing to go out again, for his hat and\r\n",
      "stick were lying on the sofa. When I entered he was standing in the\r\n",
      "middle of the room--his feet wide apart, and his head bent down. Also,\r\n",
      "he appeared to be talking to himself. But as soon as ever he saw me at\r\n",
      "the door he came towards me in such a curious manner that involuntarily\r\n",
      "I retreated a step, and was for leaving the room; whereupon he seized\r\n",
      "me by both hands, and, drawing me towards the sofa, and seating himself\r\n",
      "thereon, he forced me to sit down on a chair opposite him. Then,\r\n",
      "without letting go of my hands, he exclaimed with quivering lips and a\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "always in a disconnected sort of fashion--his one thought being to send\r\n",

      "A minute later, though sobbing and almost breathless, he managed to\r\n",

      "answers of \"Yes, yes,\" and again started to maunder about the Prince,\r\n",
      "and the likelihood of the latter marrying Mlle. Blanche. \"What on earth\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Nothing could be done with such a man. Yet to leave him alone was\r\n",
      "dangerous, for something might happen to him. I withdrew from his rooms\r\n",

      "declining to come with me this evening. Now I am without money--without\r\n",
      "a single groat. But I must not delay a moment; I must leave by the 9:30\r\n",

      "counted out the three thousand francs under a note of hand which she\r\n",
      "duly signed. Then, his business done, he bowed, and lost no time in\r\n",
      "taking his departure.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You too leave me, Alexis Ivanovitch,\" said the Grandmother. \"All my\r\n",

      "hard upon me, old fool that I am. Never again shall I blame young\r\n",
      "people for being frivolous. I should think it wrong even to blame that\r\n",
      "unhappy General of yours. Nevertheless, I do not mean to let him have\r\n",
      "any of my money (which is all that he desires), for the reason that I\r\n",
      "look upon him as a perfect blockhead, and consider myself, simpleton\r\n",
      "though I be, at least wiser than HE is. How surely does God visit old\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "However, I had a mind to see the old lady off; and, moreover, I was in\r\n",
      "an expectant frame of mind--somehow I kept thinking that SOMETHING was\r\n",
      "going to happen; wherefore, I could not rest quietly in my room, but\r\n",
      "stepped out into the corridor, and then into the Chestnut Avenue for a\r\n",
      "few minutes' stroll. My letter to Polina had been clear and firm, and\r\n",
      "in the present crisis, I felt sure, would prove final. I had heard of\r\n",
      "De Griers' departure, and, however much Polina might reject me as a\r\n",
      "FRIEND, she might not reject me altogether as a SERVANT. She would need\r\n",

      "have been otherwise?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Towards the hour of the train's departure I hastened to the station,\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Thanks for your disinterested assistance,\" she said at parting. \"Oh,\r\n",

      "soon to see her.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then I returned home. As I was passing the door of the General's suite,\r\n",
      "I met the nursemaid, and inquired after her master. \"There is nothing\r\n",
      "new to report, sir,\" she replied quietly. Nevertheless I decided to\r\n",
      "enter, and was just doing so when I halted thunderstruck on the\r\n",
      "threshold. For before me I beheld the General and Mlle.\r\n",
      "Blanche--laughing gaily at one another!--while beside them, on the\r\n",
      "sofa, there was seated her mother. Clearly the General was almost out\r\n",
      "of his mind with joy, for he was talking all sorts of nonsense, and\r\n",
      "bubbling over with a long-drawn, nervous laugh--a laugh which twisted\r\n",
      "his face into innumerable wrinkles, and caused his eyes almost to\r\n",
      "disappear.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Afterwards I learnt from Mlle. Blanche herself that, after dismissing\r\n",
      "the Prince and hearing of the General's tears, she bethought her of\r\n",
      "going to comfort the old man, and had just arrived for the purpose when\r\n",
      "I entered. Fortunately, the poor General did not know that his fate had\r\n",
      "been decided--that Mlle. had long ago packed her trunks in readiness\r\n",
      "for the first morning train to Paris!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Hesitating a moment on the threshold I changed my mind as to entering,\r\n",
      "and departed unnoticed. Ascending to my own room, and opening the door,\r\n",
      "I perceived in the semi-darkness a figure seated on a chair in the\r\n",
      "corner by the window. The figure did not rise when I entered, so I\r\n",
      "approached it swiftly, peered at it closely, and felt my heart almost\r\n",
      "stop beating. The figure was Polina!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "XIV\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The shock made me utter an exclamation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What is the matter? What is the matter?\" she asked in a strange voice.\r\n",
      "She was looking pale, and her eyes were dim.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What is the matter?\" I re-echoed. \"Why, the fact that you are HERE!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"If I am here, I have come with all that I have to bring,\" she said.\r\n",
      "\"Such has always been my way, as you shall presently see. Please light\r\n",
      "a candle.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I did so; whereupon she rose, approached the table, and laid upon it an\r\n",
      "open letter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Read it,\" she added.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It is De Griers' handwriting!\" I cried as I seized the document. My\r\n",
      "hands were so tremulous that the lines on the pages danced before my\r\n",
      "eyes. Although, at this distance of time, I have forgotten the exact\r\n",
      "phraseology of the missive, I append, if not the precise words, at all\r\n",
      "events the general sense.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Mademoiselle,\" the document ran, \"certain untoward circumstances\r\n",
      "compel me to depart in haste. Of course, you have of yourself remarked\r\n",
      "that hitherto I have always refrained from having any final explanation\r\n",
      "with you, for the reason that I could not well state the whole\r\n",
      "circumstances; and now to my difficulties the advent of the aged\r\n",
      "Grandmother, coupled with her subsequent proceedings, has put the final\r\n",
      "touch. Also, the involved state of my affairs forbids me to write with\r\n",
      "any finality concerning those hopes of ultimate bliss upon which, for a\r\n",
      "long while past, I have permitted myself to feed. I regret the past,\r\n",
      "but at the same time hope that in my conduct you have never been able\r\n",
      "to detect anything that was unworthy of a gentleman and a man of\r\n",
      "honour. Having lost, however, almost the whole of my money in debts\r\n",
      "incurred by your stepfather, I find myself driven to the necessity of\r\n",
      "saving the remainder; wherefore, I have instructed certain friends of\r\n",
      "mine in St. Petersburg to arrange for the sale of all the property\r\n",
      "which has been mortgaged to myself. At the same time, knowing that, in\r\n",
      "addition, your frivolous stepfather has squandered money which is\r\n",
      "exclusively yours, I have decided to absolve him from a certain moiety\r\n",
      "of the mortgages on his property, in order that you may be in a\r\n",
      "position to recover of him what you have lost, by suing him in legal\r\n",
      "fashion. I trust, therefore, that, as matters now stand, this action of\r\n",
      "mine may bring you some advantage. I trust also that this same action\r\n",
      "leaves me in the position of having fulfilled every obligation which is\r\n",
      "incumbent upon a man of honour and refinement. Rest assured that your\r\n",
      "memory will for ever remain graven in my heart.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"All this is clear enough,\" I commented. \"Surely you did not expect\r\n",
      "aught else from him?\" Somehow I was feeling annoyed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I expected nothing at all from him,\" she replied--quietly enough, to\r\n",
      "all outward seeming, yet with a note of irritation in her tone. \"Long\r\n",
      "ago I made up my mind on the subject, for I could read his thoughts,\r\n",
      "and knew what he was thinking. He thought that possibly I should sue\r\n",
      "him--that one day I might become a nuisance.\" Here Polina halted for a\r\n",
      "moment, and stood biting her lips. \"So of set purpose I redoubled my\r\n",
      "contemptuous treatment of him, and waited to see what he would do. If a\r\n",
      "telegram to say that we had become legatees had arrived from, St.\r\n",
      "Petersburg, I should have flung at him a quittance for my foolish\r\n",
      "stepfather's debts, and then dismissed him. For a long time I have\r\n",
      "hated him. Even in earlier days he was not a man; and now!--Oh, how\r\n",
      "gladly I could throw those fifty thousand roubles in his face, and spit\r\n",
      "in it, and then rub the spittle in!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But the document returning the fifty-thousand rouble mortgage--has the\r\n",

      "\"No, no; the General has not got it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Just as I expected! Well, what is the General going to do?\" Then an\r\n",
      "idea suddenly occurred to me. \"What about the Grandmother?\" I asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Polina looked at me with impatience and bewilderment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What makes you speak of HER?\" was her irritable inquiry. \"I cannot go\r\n",
      "and live with her. Nor,\" she added hotly, \"will I go down upon my knees\r\n",
      "to ANY ONE.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why should you?\" I cried. \"Yet to think that you should have loved De\r\n",
      "Griers! The villain, the villain! But I will kill him in a duel. Where\r\n",
      "is he now?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"In Frankfort, where he will be staying for the next three days.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, bid me do so, and I will go to him by the first train tomorrow,\"\r\n",
      "I exclaimed with enthusiasm.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She smiled.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"If you were to do that,\" she said, \"he would merely tell you to be so\r\n",
      "good as first to return him the fifty thousand francs. What, then,\r\n",
      "would be the use of having a quarrel with him? You talk sheer nonsense.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I ground my teeth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The question,\" I went on, \"is how to raise the fifty thousand francs.\r\n",
      "We cannot expect to find them lying about on the floor. Listen. What of\r\n",
      "Mr. Astley?\" Even as I spoke a new and strange idea formed itself in my\r\n",
      "brain.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her eyes flashed fire.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What? YOU YOURSELF wish me to leave you for him?\" she cried with a\r\n",
      "scornful look and a proud smile. Never before had she addressed me thus.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then her head must have turned dizzy with emotion, for suddenly she\r\n",
      "seated herself upon the sofa, as though she were powerless any longer\r\n",
      "to stand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A flash of lightning seemed to strike me as I stood there. I could\r\n",
      "scarcely believe my eyes or my ears. She DID love me, then! It WAS to\r\n",
      "me, and not to Mr. Astley, that she had turned! Although she, an\r\n",
      "unprotected girl, had come to me in my room--in an hotel room--and had\r\n",
      "probably compromised herself thereby, I had not understood!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then a second mad idea flashed into my brain.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Polina,\" I said, \"give me but an hour. Wait here just one hour until I\r\n",
      "return. Yes, you MUST do so. Do you not see what I mean? Just stay here\r\n",
      "for that time.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And I rushed from the room without so much as answering her look of\r\n",
      "inquiry. She called something after me, but I did not return.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sometimes it happens that the most insane thought, the most impossible\r\n",
      "conception, will become so fixed in one's head that at length one\r\n",
      "believes the thought or the conception to be reality. Moreover, if with\r\n",
      "the thought or the conception there is combined a strong, a passionate,\r\n",
      "desire, one will come to look upon the said thought or conception as\r\n",
      "something fated, inevitable, and foreordained--something bound to\r\n",
      "happen. Whether by this there is connoted something in the nature of a\r\n",
      "combination of presentiments, or a great effort of will, or a\r\n",
      "self-annulment of one's true expectations, and so on, I do not know;\r\n",
      "but, at all events that night saw happen to me (a night which I shall\r\n",
      "never forget) something in the nature of the miraculous. Although the\r\n",
      "occurrence can easily be explained by arithmetic, I still believe it to\r\n",
      "have been a miracle. Yet why did this conviction take such a hold upon\r\n",
      "me at the time, and remain with me ever since? Previously, I had\r\n",
      "thought of the idea, not as an occurrence which was ever likely to come\r\n",
      "about, but as something which NEVER could come about.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The time was a quarter past eleven o'clock when I entered the Casino in\r\n",
      "such a state of hope (though, at the same time, of agitation) as I had\r\n",
      "never before experienced. In the gaming-rooms there were still a large\r\n",
      "number of people, but not half as many as had been present in the\r\n",
      "morning.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At eleven o'clock there usually remained behind only the real, the\r\n",
      "desperate gamblers--persons for whom, at spas, there existed nothing\r\n",
      "beyond roulette, and who went thither for that alone. These gamesters\r\n",
      "took little note of what was going on around them, and were interested\r\n",
      "in none of the appurtenances of the season, but played from morning\r\n",
      "till night, and would have been ready to play through the night until\r\n",
      "dawn had that been possible. As it was, they used to disperse\r\n",
      "unwillingly when, at midnight, roulette came to an end. Likewise, as\r\n",
      "soon as ever roulette was drawing to a close and the head croupier had\r\n",
      "called \"Les trois derniers coups,\" most of them were ready to stake on\r\n",
      "the last three rounds all that they had in their pockets--and, for the\r\n",
      "most part, lost it. For my own part I proceeded towards the table at\r\n",
      "which the Grandmother had lately sat; and, since the crowd around it\r\n",
      "was not very large, I soon obtained standing room among the ring of\r\n",
      "gamblers, while directly in front of me, on the green cloth, I saw\r\n",
      "marked the word \"Passe.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Passe\" was a row of numbers from 19 to 36 inclusive; while a row of\r\n",
      "numbers from 1 to 18 inclusive was known as \"Manque.\" But what had that\r\n",
      "to do with me? I had not noticed--I had not so much as heard the\r\n",
      "numbers upon which the previous coup had fallen, and so took no\r\n",
      "bearings when I began to play, as, in my place, any SYSTEMATIC gambler\r\n",

      "involved a risk of two chances to one). The wheel revolved, and stopped\r\n",
      "at twenty-four. Upon this I was paid out notes and gold until I had by\r\n",
      "my side a total sum of two thousand gulden.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was as in a fever that I moved the pile, en bloc, on to the red.\r\n",
      "Then suddenly I came to myself (though that was the only time during\r\n",
      "the evening's play when fear cast its cold spell over me, and showed\r\n",
      "itself in a trembling of the hands and knees). For with horror I had\r\n",
      "realised that I MUST win, and that upon that stake there depended all\r\n",
      "my life.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Rouge!\" called the croupier. I drew a long breath, and hot shivers\r\n",
      "went coursing over my body. I was paid out my winnings in\r\n",
      "bank-notes--amounting, of course, to a total of four thousand florins,\r\n",
      "eight hundred gulden (I could still calculate the amounts).\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After that, I remember, I again staked two thousand florins upon twelve\r\n",
      "middle numbers, and lost. Again I staked the whole of my gold, with\r\n",
      "eight hundred gulden, in notes, and lost. Then madness seemed to come\r\n",
      "upon me, and seizing my last two thousand florins, I staked them upon\r\n",
      "twelve of the first numbers--wholly by chance, and at random, and\r\n",
      "without any sort of reckoning. Upon my doing so there followed a moment\r\n",
      "of suspense only comparable to that which Madame Blanchard must have\r\n",
      "experienced when, in Paris, she was descending earthwards from a\r\n",
      "balloon.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Quatre!\" called the croupier.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Once more, with the addition of my original stake, I was in possession\r\n",
      "of six thousand florins! Once more I looked around me like a\r\n",
      "conqueror--once more I feared nothing as I threw down four thousand of\r\n",
      "these florins upon the black. The croupiers glanced around them, and\r\n",
      "exchanged a few words; the bystanders murmured expectantly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The black turned up. After that I do not exactly remember either my\r\n",
      "calculations or the order of my stakings. I only remember that, as in a\r\n",
      "dream, I won in one round sixteen thousand florins; that in the three\r\n",
      "following rounds, I lost twelve thousand; that I moved the remainder\r\n",
      "(four thousand) on to \"Passe\" (though quite unconscious of what I was\r\n",
      "doing--I was merely waiting, as it were, mechanically, and without\r\n",
      "reflection, for something) and won; and that, finally, four times in\r\n",
      "succession I lost. Yes, I can remember raking in money by\r\n",
      "thousands--but most frequently on the twelve, middle numbers, to which\r\n",
      "I constantly adhered, and which kept appearing in a sort of regular\r\n",
      "order--first, three or four times running, and then, after an interval\r\n",
      "of a couple of rounds, in another break of three or four appearances.\r\n",
      "Sometimes, this astonishing regularity manifested itself in patches; a\r\n",
      "thing to upset all the calculations of note--taking gamblers who play\r\n",
      "with a pencil and a memorandum book in their hands Fortune perpetrates\r\n",
      "some terrible jests at roulette!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Since my entry not more than half an hour could have elapsed. Suddenly\r\n",
      "a croupier informed me that I had, won thirty thousand florins, as well\r\n",
      "as that, since the latter was the limit for which, at any one time, the\r\n",
      "bank could make itself responsible, roulette at that table must close\r\n",
      "for the night. Accordingly, I caught up my pile of gold, stuffed it\r\n",
      "into my pocket, and, grasping my sheaf of bank-notes, moved to the\r\n",
      "table in an adjoining salon where a second game of roulette was in\r\n",
      "progress. The crowd followed me in a body, and cleared a place for me\r\n",
      "at the table; after which, I proceeded to stake as before--that is to\r\n",
      "say, at random and without calculating. What saved me from ruin I do\r\n",
      "not know.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Of course there were times when fragmentary reckonings DID come\r\n",
      "flashing into my brain. For instance, there were times when I attached\r\n",
      "myself for a while to certain figures and coups--though always leaving\r\n",
      "them, again before long, without knowing what I was doing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In fact, I cannot have been in possession of all my faculties, for I\r\n",
      "can remember the croupiers correcting my play more than once, owing to\r\n",
      "my having made mistakes of the gravest order. My brows were damp with\r\n",
      "sweat, and my hands were shaking. Also, Poles came around me to proffer\r\n",
      "their services, but I heeded none of them. Nor did my luck fail me now.\r\n",
      "Suddenly, there arose around me a loud din of talking and laughter.\r\n",
      "\"Bravo, bravo!\" was the general shout, and some people even clapped\r\n",
      "their hands. I had raked in thirty thousand florins, and again the bank\r\n",
      "had had to close for the night!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Go away now, go away now,\" a voice whispered to me on my right. The\r\n",
      "person who had spoken to me was a certain Jew of Frankfurt--a man who\r\n",
      "had been standing beside me the whole while, and occasionally helping\r\n",
      "me in my play.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, for God's sake go,\" whispered a second voice in my left ear.\r\n",
      "Glancing around, I perceived that the second voice had come from a\r\n",
      "modestly, plainly dressed lady of rather less than thirty--a woman\r\n",
      "whose face, though pale and sickly-looking, bore also very evident\r\n",
      "traces of former beauty. At the moment, I was stuffing the crumpled\r\n",
      "bank-notes into my pockets and collecting all the gold that was left on\r\n",
      "the table. Seizing up my last note for five hundred gulden, I contrived\r\n",
      "to insinuate it, unperceived, into the hand of the pale lady. An\r\n",
      "overpowering impulse had made me do so, and I remember how her thin\r\n",
      "little fingers pressed mine in token of her lively gratitude. The whole\r\n",
      "affair was the work of a moment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then, collecting my belongings, I crossed to where trente et quarante\r\n",
      "was being played--a game which could boast of a more aristocratic\r\n",
      "public, and was played with cards instead of with a wheel. At this\r\n",
      "diversion the bank made itself responsible for a hundred thousand\r\n",
      "thalers as the limit, but the highest stake allowable was, as in\r\n",
      "roulette, four thousand florins. Although I knew nothing of the\r\n",
      "game--and I scarcely knew the stakes, except those on black and red--I\r\n",
      "joined the ring of players, while the rest of the crowd massed itself\r\n",
      "around me. At this distance of time I cannot remember whether I ever\r\n",
      "gave a thought to Polina; I seemed only to be conscious of a vague\r\n",
      "pleasure in seizing and raking in the bank-notes which kept massing\r\n",
      "themselves in a pile before me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But, as ever, fortune seemed to be at my back. As though of set\r\n",
      "purpose, there came to my aid a circumstance which not infrequently\r\n",
      "repeats itself in gaming. The circumstance is that not infrequently\r\n",
      "luck attaches itself to, say, the red, and does not leave it for a\r\n",
      "space of say, ten, or even fifteen, rounds in succession. Three days\r\n",
      "ago I had heard that, during the previous week there had been a run of\r\n",
      "twenty-two coups on the red--an occurrence never before known at\r\n",
      "roulette--so that men spoke of it with astonishment. Naturally enough,\r\n",
      "many deserted the red after a dozen rounds, and practically no one\r\n",
      "could now be found to stake upon it. Yet upon the black also--the\r\n",
      "antithesis of the red--no experienced gambler would stake anything, for\r\n",
      "the reason that every practised player knows the meaning of \"capricious\r\n",
      "fortune.\" That is to say, after the sixteenth (or so) success of the\r\n",
      "red, one would think that the seventeenth coup would inevitably fall\r\n",
      "upon the black; wherefore, novices would be apt to back the latter in\r\n",
      "the seventeenth round, and even to double or treble their stakes upon\r\n",
      "it--only, in the end, to lose.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Yet some whim or other led me, on remarking that the red had come up\r\n",
      "consecutively for seven times, to attach myself to that colour.\r\n",
      "Probably this was mostly due to self-conceit, for I wanted to astonish\r\n",
      "the bystanders with the riskiness of my play. Also, I remember\r\n",
      "that--oh, strange sensation!--I suddenly, and without any challenge\r\n",
      "from my own presumption, became obsessed with a DESIRE to take risks.\r\n",
      "If the spirit has passed through a great many sensations, possibly it\r\n",
      "can no longer be sated with them, but grows more excited, and demands\r\n",
      "more sensations, and stronger and stronger ones, until at length it\r\n",
      "falls exhausted. Certainly, if the rules of the game had permitted even\r\n",
      "of my staking fifty thousand florins at a time, I should have staked\r\n",
      "them. All of a sudden I heard exclamations arising that the whole thing\r\n",
      "was a marvel, since the red was turning up for the fourteenth time!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Monsieur a gagne cent mille florins,\" a voice exclaimed beside me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I awoke to my senses. What? I had won a hundred thousand florins? If\r\n",
      "so, what more did I need to win? I grasped the banknotes, stuffed them\r\n",
      "into my pockets, raked in the gold without counting it, and started to\r\n",
      "leave the Casino. As I passed through the salons people smiled to see\r\n",
      "my bulging pockets and unsteady gait, for the weight which I was\r\n",
      "carrying must have amounted to half a pood! Several hands I saw\r\n",
      "stretched out in my direction, and as I passed I filled them with all\r\n",
      "the money that I could grasp in my own. At length two Jews stopped me\r\n",
      "near the exit.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You are a bold young fellow,\" one said, \"but mind you depart early\r\n",
      "tomorrow--as early as you can--for if you do not you will lose\r\n",
      "everything that you have won.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But I did not heed them. The Avenue was so dark that it was barely\r\n",
      "possible to distinguish one's hand before one's face, while the\r\n",
      "distance to the hotel was half a verst or so; but I feared neither\r\n",
      "pickpockets nor highwaymen. Indeed, never since my boyhood have I done\r\n",
      "that. Also, I cannot remember what I thought about on the way. I only\r\n",
      "felt a sort of fearful pleasure--the pleasure of success, of conquest,\r\n",
      "of power (how can I best express it?). Likewise, before me there\r\n",
      "flitted the image of Polina; and I kept remembering, and reminding\r\n",
      "myself, that it was to HER I was going, that it was in HER presence I\r\n",
      "should soon be standing, that it was SHE to whom I should soon be able\r\n",
      "to relate and show everything. Scarcely once did I recall what she had\r\n",
      "lately said to me, or the reason why I had left her, or all those\r\n",
      "varied sensations which I had been experiencing a bare hour and a half\r\n",
      "ago. No, those sensations seemed to be things of the past, to be things\r\n",
      "which had righted themselves and grown old, to be things concerning\r\n",
      "which we needed to trouble ourselves no longer, since, for us, life was\r\n",
      "about to begin anew. Yet I had just reached the end of the Avenue when\r\n",
      "there DID come upon me a fear of being robbed or murdered. With each\r\n",
      "step the fear increased until, in my terror, I almost started to run.\r\n",
      "Suddenly, as I issued from the Avenue, there burst upon me the lights\r\n",
      "of the hotel, sparkling with a myriad lamps! Yes, thanks be to God, I\r\n",
      "had reached home!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Running up to my room, I flung open the door of it.  Polina was still\r\n",
      "on the sofa, with a lighted candle in front of her, and her hands\r\n",
      "clasped. As I entered she stared at me in astonishment (for, at the\r\n",
      "moment, I must have presented a strange spectacle). All I did, however,\r\n",
      "was to halt before her, and fling upon the table my burden of wealth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "XV\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I remember, too, how, without moving from her place, or changing her\r\n",
      "attitude, she gazed into my face.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I have won two hundred thousand francs!\" cried I as I pulled out my\r\n",
      "last sheaf of bank-notes. The pile of paper currency occupied the whole\r\n",
      "table. I could not withdraw my eyes from it. Consequently, for a moment\r\n",
      "or two Polina escaped my mind. Then I set myself to arrange the pile in\r\n",
      "order, and to sort the notes, and to mass the gold in a separate heap.\r\n",
      "That done, I left everything where it lay, and proceeded to pace the\r\n",
      "room with rapid strides as I lost myself in thought. Then I darted to\r\n",
      "the table once more, and began to recount the money; until all of a\r\n",
      "sudden, as though I had remembered something, I rushed to the door, and\r\n",
      "closed and double-locked it. Finally I came to a meditative halt before\r\n",
      "my little trunk.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Shall I put the money there until tomorrow?\" I asked, turning sharply\r\n",
      "round to Polina as the recollection of her returned to me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She was still in her old place--still making not a sound. Yet her eyes\r\n",
      "had followed every one of my movements. Somehow in her face there was a\r\n",
      "strange expression--an expression which I did not like. I think that I\r\n",
      "shall not be wrong if I say that it indicated sheer hatred.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Impulsively I approached her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Polina,\" I said, \"here are twenty-five thousand florins--fifty\r\n",
      "thousand francs, or more. Take them, and tomorrow throw them in De\r\n",
      "Griers' face.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She returned no answer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Or, if you should prefer,\" I continued, \"let me take them to him\r\n",
      "myself tomorrow--yes, early tomorrow morning. Shall I?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then all at once she burst out laughing, and laughed for a long while.\r\n",
      "With astonishment and a feeling of offence I gazed at her. Her laughter\r\n",
      "was too like the derisive merriment which she had so often indulged in\r\n",
      "of late--merriment which had broken forth always at the time of my most\r\n",
      "passionate explanations. At length she ceased, and frowned at me from\r\n",
      "under her eyebrows.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I am NOT going to take your money,\" she said contemptuously.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why not?\" I cried. \"Why not, Polina?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Because I am not in the habit of receiving money for nothing.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But I am offering it to you as a FRIEND in the same way I would offer\r\n",
      "you my very life.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Upon this she threw me a long, questioning glance, as though she were\r\n",
      "seeking to probe me to the depths.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You are giving too much for me,\" she remarked with a smile. \"The\r\n",
      "beloved of De Griers is not worth fifty thousand francs.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh Polina, how can you speak so?\" I exclaimed reproachfully. \"Am I De\r\n",
      "Griers?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You?\" she cried with her eyes suddenly flashing. \"Why, I HATE you!\r\n",
      "Yes, yes, I HATE you! I love you no more than I do De Griers.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then she buried her face in her hands, and relapsed into hysterics. I\r\n",
      "darted to her side. Somehow I had an intuition of something having\r\n",
      "happened to her which had nothing to do with myself. She was like a\r\n",
      "person temporarily insane.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Buy me, would you, would you? Would you buy me for fifty thousand\r\n",
      "francs as De Griers did?\" she gasped between her convulsive sobs.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I clasped her in my arms, kissed her hands and feet, and fell upon my\r\n",
      "knees before her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Presently the hysterical fit passed away, and, laying her hands upon my\r\n",
      "shoulders, she gazed for a while into my face, as though trying to read\r\n",
      "it--something I said to her, but it was clear that she did not hear it.\r\n",
      "Her face looked so dark and despondent that I began to fear for her\r\n",
      "reason. At length she drew me towards herself--a trustful smile playing\r\n",
      "over her features; and then, as suddenly, she pushed me away again as\r\n",
      "she eyed me dimly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Finally she threw herself upon me in an embrace.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You love me?\" she said. \"DO you?--you who were willing even to quarrel\r\n",
      "with the Baron at my bidding?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then she laughed--laughed as though something dear, but laughable, had\r\n",
      "recurred to her memory. Yes, she laughed and wept at the same time.\r\n",
      "What was I to do? I was like a man in a fever. I remember that she\r\n",
      "began to say something to me--though WHAT I do not know, since she\r\n",
      "spoke with a feverish lisp, as though she were trying to tell me\r\n",
      "something very quickly. At intervals, too, she would break off into the\r\n",
      "smile which I was beginning to dread. \"No, no!\" she kept repeating.\r\n",
      "\"YOU are my dear one; YOU are the man I trust.\" Again she laid her\r\n",
      "hands upon my shoulders, and again she gazed at me as she reiterated:\r\n",
      "\"You love me, you love me? Will you ALWAYS love me?\" I could not take\r\n",
      "my eyes off her. Never before had I seen her in this mood of humility\r\n",
      "and affection. True, the mood was the outcome of hysteria; but--! All\r\n",
      "of a sudden she noticed my ardent gaze, and smiled slightly. The next\r\n",
      "moment, for no apparent reason, she began to talk of Astley.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She continued talking and talking about him, but I could not make out\r\n",
      "all she said--more particularly when she was endeavouring to tell me of\r\n",
      "something or other which had happened recently. On the whole, she\r\n",
      "appeared to be laughing at Astley, for she kept repeating that he was\r\n",
      "waiting for her, and did I know whether, even at that moment, he was\r\n",
      "not standing beneath the window? \"Yes, yes, he is there,\" she said.\r\n",
      "\"Open the window, and see if he is not.\" She pushed me in that\r\n",
      "direction; yet, no sooner did I make a movement to obey her behest than\r\n",
      "she burst into laughter, and I remained beside her, and she embraced me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Shall we go away tomorrow?\" presently she asked, as though some\r\n",
      "disturbing thought had recurred to her recollection. \"How would it be\r\n",
      "if we were to try and overtake Grandmamma? I think we should do so at\r\n",
      "Berlin. And what think you she would have to say to us when we caught\r\n",
      "her up, and her eyes first lit upon us? What, too, about Mr. Astley? HE\r\n",
      "would not leap from the Shlangenberg for my sake! No! Of that I am very\r\n",
      "sure!\"--and she laughed. \"Do you know where he is going next year? He\r\n",
      "says he intends to go to the North Pole for scientific investigations,\r\n",
      "and has invited me to go with him! Ha, ha, ha! He also says that we\r\n",
      "Russians know nothing, can do nothing, without European help. But he is\r\n",
      "a good fellow all the same. For instance, he does not blame the General\r\n",
      "in the matter, but declares that Mlle. Blanche--that love--But no; I do\r\n",
      "not know, I do not know.\" She stopped suddenly, as though she had said\r\n",
      "her say, and was feeling bewildered. \"What poor creatures these people\r\n",
      "are. How sorry I am for them, and for Grandmamma! But when are you\r\n",
      "going to kill De Griers? Surely you do not intend actually to murder\r\n",
      "him? You fool! Do you suppose that I should ALLOW you to fight De\r\n",
      "Griers? Nor shall you kill the Baron.\" Here she burst out laughing.\r\n",
      "\"How absurd you looked when you were talking to the Burmergelms! I was\r\n",
      "watching you all the time--watching you from where I was sitting. And\r\n",
      "how unwilling you were to go when I sent you! Oh, how I laughed and\r\n",
      "laughed!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then she kissed and embraced me again; again she pressed her face to\r\n",
      "mine with tender passion. Yet I neither saw nor heard her, for my head\r\n",
      "was in a whirl....\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It must have been about seven o'clock in the morning when I awoke.\r\n",
      "Daylight had come, and Polina was sitting by my side--a strange\r\n",
      "expression on her face, as though she had seen a vision and was unable\r\n",
      "to collect her thoughts. She too had just awoken, and was now staring\r\n",
      "at the money on the table. My head ached; it felt heavy. I attempted to\r\n",
      "take Polina's hand, but she pushed me from her, and leapt from the\r\n",
      "sofa. The dawn was full of mist, for rain had fallen, yet she moved to\r\n",
      "the window, opened it, and, leaning her elbows upon the window-sill,\r\n",
      "thrust out her head and shoulders to take the air. In this position did\r\n",
      "she remain for several minutes, without ever looking round at me, or\r\n",
      "listening to what I was saying. Into my head there came the uneasy\r\n",
      "thought: What is to happen now? How is it all to end? Suddenly Polina\r\n",
      "rose from the window, approached the table, and, looking at me with an\r\n",
      "expression of infinite aversion, said with lips which quivered with\r\n",
      "anger:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well? Are you going to hand me over my fifty thousand francs?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Polina, you say that AGAIN, AGAIN?\" I exclaimed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You have changed your mind, then? Ha, ha, ha! You are sorry you ever\r\n",
      "promised them?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On the table where, the previous night, I had counted the money there\r\n",
      "still was lying the packet of twenty five thousand florins. I handed it\r\n",
      "to her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The francs are mine, then, are they? They are mine?\" she inquired\r\n",
      "viciously as she balanced the money in her hands.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes; they have ALWAYS been yours,\" I said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then TAKE your fifty thousand francs!\" and she hurled them full in my\r\n",
      "face. The packet burst as she did so, and the floor became strewed with\r\n",
      "bank-notes. The instant that the deed was done she rushed from the room.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At that moment she cannot have been in her right mind; yet, what was\r\n",
      "the cause of her temporary aberration I cannot say. For a month past\r\n",
      "she had been unwell. Yet what had brought about this PRESENT condition\r\n",
      "of mind, above all things, this outburst? Had it come of wounded pride?\r\n",
      "Had it come of despair over her decision to come to me? Had it come of\r\n",
      "the fact that, presuming too much on my good fortune, I had seemed to\r\n",
      "be intending to desert her (even as De Griers had done) when once I had\r\n",
      "given her the fifty thousand francs? But, on my honour, I had never\r\n",
      "cherished any such intention. What was at fault, I think, was her own\r\n",
      "pride, which kept urging her not to trust me, but, rather, to insult\r\n",
      "me--even though she had not realised the fact. In her eyes I\r\n",
      "corresponded to De Griers, and therefore had been condemned for a fault\r\n",
      "not wholly my own. Her mood of late had been a sort of delirium, a sort\r\n",
      "of light-headedness--that I knew full well; yet, never had I\r\n",
      "sufficiently taken it into consideration. Perhaps she would not pardon\r\n",
      "me now? Ah, but this was THE PRESENT. What about the future? Her\r\n",
      "delirium and sickness were not likely to make her forget what she had\r\n",
      "done in bringing me De Griers' letter. No, she must have known what she\r\n",
      "was doing when she brought it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Somehow I contrived to stuff the pile of notes and gold under the bed,\r\n",
      "to cover them over, and then to leave the room some ten minutes after\r\n",
      "Polina. I felt sure that she had returned to her own room; wherefore, I\r\n",
      "intended quietly to follow her, and to ask the nursemaid aid who opened\r\n",
      "the door how her mistress was. Judge, therefore, of my surprise when,\r\n",
      "meeting the domestic on the stairs, she informed me that Polina had not\r\n",
      "yet returned, and that she (the domestic) was at that moment on her way\r\n",
      "to my room in quest of her!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Mlle. left me but ten minutes ago,\" I said. \"What can have become of\r\n",
      "her?\" The nursemaid looked at me reproachfully.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Already sundry rumours were flying about the hotel. Both in the office\r\n",
      "of the commissionaire and in that of the landlord it was whispered\r\n",
      "that, at seven o'clock that morning, the Fraulein had left the hotel,\r\n",
      "and set off, despite the rain, in the direction of the Hotel\r\n",
      "d'Angleterre. From words and hints let fall I could see that the fact\r\n",
      "of Polina having spent the night in my room was now public property.\r\n",
      "Also, sundry rumours were circulating concerning the General's family\r\n",
      "affairs. It was known that last night he had gone out of his mind, and\r\n",
      "paraded the hotel in tears; also, that the old lady who had arrived was\r\n",
      "his mother, and that she had come from Russia on purpose to forbid her\r\n",
      "son's marriage with Mlle. de Cominges, as well as to cut him out of her\r\n",
      "will if he should disobey her; also that, because he had disobeyed her,\r\n",
      "she had squandered all her money at roulette, in order to have nothing\r\n",
      "more to leave to him. \"Oh, these Russians!\" exclaimed the landlord,\r\n",
      "with an angry toss of the head, while the bystanders laughed and the\r\n",
      "clerk betook himself to his accounts. Also, every one had learnt about\r\n",
      "my winnings; Karl, the corridor lacquey, was the first to congratulate\r\n",
      "me. But with these folk I had nothing to do. My business was to set off\r\n",
      "at full speed to the Hotel d'Angleterre.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As yet it was early for Mr. Astley to receive visitors; but, as soon as\r\n",
      "he learnt that it was I who had arrived, he came out into the corridor\r\n",
      "to meet me, and stood looking at me in silence with his steel-grey eyes\r\n",
      "as he waited to hear what I had to say. I inquired after Polina.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She is ill,\" he replied, still looking at me with his direct,\r\n",
      "unwavering glance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And she is in your rooms.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, she is in my rooms.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then you are minded to keep her there?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, I am minded to keep her there.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But, Mr. Astley, that will raise a scandal. It ought not to be\r\n",
      "allowed. Besides, she is very ill. Perhaps you had not remarked that?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, I have. It was I who told you about it. Had she not been ill, she\r\n",
      "would not have gone and spent the night with you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then you know all about it?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes; for last night she was to have accompanied me to the house of a\r\n",
      "relative of mine. Unfortunately, being ill, she made a mistake, and\r\n",
      "went to your rooms instead.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Indeed? Then I wish you joy, Mr. Astley. Apropos, you have reminded me\r\n",
      "of something. Were you beneath my window last night? Every moment Mlle.\r\n",
      "Polina kept telling me to open the window and see if you were there;\r\n",
      "after which she always smiled.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Indeed? No, I was not there; but I was waiting in the corridor, and\r\n",
      "walking about the hotel.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She ought to see a doctor, you know, Mr. Astley.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, she ought. I have sent for one, and, if she dies, I shall hold\r\n",
      "you responsible.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This surprised me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Pardon me,\" I replied, \"but what do you mean?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Never mind. Tell me if it is true that, last night, you won two\r\n",
      "hundred thousand thalers?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No; I won a hundred thousand florins.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Good heavens! Then I suppose you will be off to Paris this morning?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Because all Russians who have grown rich go to Paris,\" explained\r\n",
      "Astley, as though he had read the fact in a book.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But what could I do in Paris in summer time?--I LOVE her, Mr. Astley!\r\n",
      "Surely you know that?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Indeed? I am sure that you do NOT. Moreover, if you were to stay here,\r\n",
      "you would lose everything that you possess, and have nothing left with\r\n",
      "which to pay your expenses in Paris. Well, good-bye now. I feel sure\r\n",
      "that today will see you gone from here.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Good-bye. But I am NOT going to Paris. Likewise--pardon me--what is to\r\n",
      "become of this family? I mean that the affair of the General and Mlle.\r\n",
      "Polina will soon be all over the town.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I daresay; yet, I hardly suppose that that will break the General's\r\n",
      "heart. Moreover, Mlle. Polina has a perfect right to live where she\r\n",
      "chooses. In short, we may say that, as a family, this family has ceased\r\n",
      "to exist.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I departed, and found myself smiling at the Englishman's strange\r\n",
      "assurance that I should soon be leaving for Paris. \"I suppose he means\r\n",
      "to shoot me in a duel, should Polina die. Yes, that is what he intends\r\n",
      "to do.\"  Now, although I was honestly sorry for Polina, it is a fact\r\n",
      "that, from the moment when, the previous night, I had approached the\r\n",
      "gaming-table, and begun to rake in the packets of bank-notes, my love\r\n",
      "for her had entered upon a new plane. Yes, I can say that now;\r\n",
      "although, at the time, I was barely conscious of it. Was I, then, at\r\n",
      "heart a gambler? Did I, after all, love Polina not so very much? No,\r\n",
      "no! As God is my witness, I loved her! Even when I was returning home\r\n",
      "from Mr. Astley's my suffering was genuine, and my self-reproach\r\n",
      "sincere. But presently I was to go through an exceedingly strange and\r\n",
      "ugly experience.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I was proceeding to the General's rooms when I heard a door near me\r\n",
      "open, and a voice call me by name. It was Mlle.'s mother, the Widow de\r\n",
      "Cominges who was inviting me, in her daughter's name, to enter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I did so; whereupon, I heard a laugh and a little cry proceed from the\r\n",
      "bedroom (the pair occupied a suite of two apartments), where Mlle.\r\n",
      "Blanche was just arising.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah, c'est lui! Viens, donc, bete! Is it true that you have won a\r\n",
      "mountain of gold and silver? J'aimerais mieux l'or.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes,\" I replied with a smile.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"How much?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"A hundred thousand florins.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Bibi, comme tu es bete! Come in here, for I can't hear you where you\r\n",
      "are now. Nous ferons bombance, n'est-ce pas?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Entering her room, I found her lolling under a pink satin coverlet, and\r\n",
      "revealing a pair of swarthy, wonderfully healthy shoulders--shoulders\r\n",
      "such as one sees in dreams--shoulders covered over with a white cambric\r\n",
      "nightgown which, trimmed with lace, stood out, in striking relief,\r\n",
      "against the darkness of her skin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Mon fils, as-tu du coeur?\" she cried when she saw me, and then\r\n",
      "giggled. Her laugh had always been a very cheerful one, and at times it\r\n",
      "even sounded sincere.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Tout autre--\" I began, paraphrasing Corneille.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"See here,\" she prattled on. \"Please search for my stockings, and help\r\n",
      "me to dress. Aussi, si tu n'es pas trop bete je te prends a Paris. I am\r\n",
      "just off, let me tell you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"This moment?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"In half an hour.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "True enough, everything stood ready-packed--trunks, portmanteaux, and\r\n",
      "all. Coffee had long been served.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Eh bien, tu verras Paris. Dis donc, qu'est-ce que c'est qu'un\r\n",
      "'utchitel'? Tu etais bien bete quand tu etais 'utchitel.' Where are my\r\n",
      "stockings? Please help me to dress.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And she lifted up a really ravishing foot--small, swarthy, and not\r\n",
      "misshapen like the majority of feet which look dainty only in bottines.\r\n",
      "I laughed, and started to draw on to the foot a silk stocking, while\r\n",
      "Mlle. Blanche sat on the edge of the bed and chattered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Eh bien, que feras-tu si je te prends avec moi? First of all I must\r\n",
      "have fifty thousand francs, and you shall give them to me at Frankfurt.\r\n",
      "Then we will go on to Paris, where we will live together, et je te\r\n",
      "ferai voir des etoiles en plein jour. Yes, you shall see such women as\r\n",
      "your eyes have never lit upon.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Stop a moment. If I were to give you those fifty thousand francs, what\r\n",
      "should I have left for myself?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Another hundred thousand francs, please to remember. Besides, I could\r\n",
      "live with you in your rooms for a month, or even for two; or even for\r\n",
      "longer. But it would not take us more than two months to get through\r\n",
      "fifty thousand francs; for, look you, je suis bonne enfante, et tu\r\n",
      "verras des etoiles, you may be sure.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What? You mean to say that we should spend the whole in two months?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Certainly. Does that surprise you very much? Ah, vil esclave! Why, one\r\n",
      "month of that life would be better than all your previous existence.\r\n",
      "One month--et apres, le deluge! Mais tu ne peux comprendre. Va! Away,\r\n",
      "away! You are not worth it.--Ah, que fais-tu?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For, while drawing on the other stocking, I had felt constrained to\r\n",
      "kiss her. Immediately she shrunk back, kicked me in the face with her\r\n",
      "toes, and turned me neck and prop out of the room.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Eh bien, mon 'utchitel',\" she called after me, \"je t'attends, si tu\r\n",
      "veux. I start in a quarter of an hour's time.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I returned to my own room with my head in a whirl. It was not my fault\r\n",
      "that Polina had thrown a packet in my face, and preferred Mr. Astley to\r\n",
      "myself. A few bank-notes were still fluttering about the floor, and I\r\n",
      "picked them up. At that moment the door opened, and the landlord\r\n",
      "appeared--a person who, until now, had never bestowed upon me so much\r\n",
      "as a glance. He had come to know if I would prefer to move to a lower\r\n",
      "floor--to a suite which had just been tenanted by Count V.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For a moment I reflected.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No!\" I shouted. \"My account, please, for in ten minutes I shall be\r\n",
      "gone.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"To Paris, to Paris!\" I added to myself. \"Every man of birth must make\r\n",
      "her acquaintance.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Within a quarter of an hour all three of us were seated in a family\r\n",
      "compartment--Mlle. Blanche, the Widow de Cominges, and myself. Mlle.\r\n",
      "kept laughing hysterically as she looked at me, and Madame re-echoed\r\n",
      "her; but I did not feel so cheerful. My life had broken in two, and\r\n",
      "yesterday had infected me with a habit of staking my all upon a card.\r\n",
      "Although it might be that I had failed to win my stake, that I had lost\r\n",
      "my senses, that I desired nothing better, I felt that the scene was to\r\n",
      "be changed only FOR A TIME. \"Within a month from now,\" I kept thinking\r\n",
      "to myself, \"I shall be back again in Roulettenberg; and THEN I mean to\r\n",
      "have it out with you, Mr. Astley!\" Yes, as now I look back at things, I\r\n",
      "remember that I felt greatly depressed, despite the absurd gigglings of\r\n",
      "the egregious Blanche.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What is the matter with you? How dull you are!\" she cried at length as\r\n",
      "she interrupted her laughter to take me seriously to task.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Come, come! We are going to spend your two hundred thousand francs for\r\n",
      "you, et tu seras heureux comme un petit roi. I myself will tie your tie\r\n",
      "for you, and introduce you to Hortense. And when we have spent your\r\n",
      "money you shall return here, and break the bank again. What did those\r\n",
      "two Jews tell you?--that the thing most needed is daring, and that you\r\n",
      "possess it? Consequently, this is not the first time that you will be\r\n",
      "hurrying to Paris with money in your pocket. Quant ... moi, je veux\r\n",
      "cinquante mille francs de rente, et alors.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But what about the General?\" I interrupted.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The General? You know well enough that at about this hour every day he\r\n",
      "goes to buy me a bouquet. On this occasion, I took care to tell him\r\n",
      "that he must hunt for the choicest of flowers; and when he returns\r\n",
      "home, the poor fellow will find the bird flown. Possibly he may take\r\n",
      "wing in pursuit--ha, ha, ha! And if so, I shall not be sorry, for he\r\n",
      "could be useful to me in Paris, and Mr. Astley will pay his debts here.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In this manner did I depart for the Gay City.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "XVI\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Of Paris what am I to say? The whole proceeding was a delirium, a\r\n",
      "madness. I spent a little over three weeks there, and, during that\r\n",
      "time, saw my hundred thousand francs come to an end. I speak only of\r\n",
      "the ONE hundred thousand francs, for the other hundred thousand I gave\r\n",
      "to Mlle. Blanche in pure cash. That is to say, I handed her fifty\r\n",
      "thousand francs at Frankfurt, and, three days later (in Paris),\r\n",
      "advanced her another fifty thousand on note of hand. Nevertheless, a\r\n",
      "week had not elapsed ere she came to me for more money. \"Et les cent\r\n",
      "mille francs qui nous restent,\" she added, \"tu les mangeras avec moi,\r\n",
      "mon utchitel.\" Yes, she always called me her \"utchitel.\" A person more\r\n",
      "economical, grasping, and mean than Mlle. Blanche one could not\r\n",
      "imagine. But this was only as regards HER OWN money. MY hundred\r\n",
      "thousand francs (as she explained to me later) she needed to set up her\r\n",
      "establishment in Paris, \"so that once and for all I may be on a decent\r\n",
      "footing, and proof against any stones which may be thrown at me--at all\r\n",
      "events for a long time to come.\" Nevertheless, I saw nothing of those\r\n",
      "hundred thousand francs, for my own purse (which she inspected daily)\r\n",
      "never managed to amass in it more than a hundred francs at a time; and,\r\n",
      "generally the sum did not reach even that figure.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What do you want with money?\" she would say to me with air of absolute\r\n",
      "simplicity; and I never disputed the point. Nevertheless, though she\r\n",
      "fitted out her flat very badly with the money, the fact did not prevent\r\n",
      "her from saying when, later, she was showing me over the rooms of her\r\n",

      "means!\" However, her \"wretchedness\" had cost fifty thousand francs,\r\n",
      "while with the remaining fifty thousand she purchased a carriage and\r\n",
      "horses.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Also, we gave a couple of balls--evening parties attended by Hortense\r\n",
      "and Lisette and Cleopatre, who were women remarkable both for the\r\n",
      "number of their liaisons and (though only in some cases) for their good\r\n",
      "looks. At these reunions I had to play the part of host--to meet and\r\n",
      "entertain fat mercantile parvenus who were impossible by reason of\r\n",
      "their rudeness and braggadocio, colonels of various kinds, hungry\r\n",
      "authors, and journalistic hacks--all of whom disported themselves in\r\n",

      "of me, but I would console myself by drinking champagne and then\r\n",
      "lolling in a retiring-room. Nevertheless, I found it deadly work.\r\n",
      "\"C'est un utchitel,\" Blanche would say of me, \"qui a gagne deux cent\r\n",
      "mille francs, and but for me, would have had not a notion how to spend\r\n",
      "them. Presently he will have to return to his tutoring. Does any one\r\n",
      "know of a vacant post? You know, one must do something for him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I had the more frequent recourse to champagne in that I constantly felt\r\n",
      "depressed and bored, owing to the fact that I was living in the most\r\n",
      "bourgeois commercial milieu imaginable--a milieu wherein every sou was\r\n",

      "dressed me in elegant clothes, and herself tied my tie each day. In\r\n",
      "short, she utterly despised me. But that caused me no concern. Blase\r\n",
      "and inert, I spent my evenings generally at the Chateau des Fleurs,\r\n",
      "where I would get fuddled and then dance the cancan (which, in that\r\n",
      "establishment, was a very indecent performance) with eclat. At length,\r\n",
      "the time came when Blanche had drained my purse dry. She had conceived\r\n",
      "an idea that, during the term of our residence together, it would be\r\n",
      "well if I were always to walk behind her with a paper and pencil, in\r\n",
      "order to jot down exactly what she spent, what she had saved, what she\r\n",
      "was paying out, and what she was laying by. Well, of course I could not\r\n",
      "fail to be aware that this would entail a battle over every ten francs;\r\n",
      "so, although for every possible objection that I might make she had\r\n",
      "prepared a suitable answer, she soon saw that I made no objections, and\r\n",
      "therefore, had to start disputes herself. That is to say, she would\r\n",
      "burst out into tirades which were met only with silence as I lolled on\r\n",
      "a sofa and stared fixedly at the ceiling. This greatly surprised her.\r\n",
      "At first she imagined that it was due merely to the fact that I was a\r\n",
      "fool, \"un utchitel\"; wherefore she would break off her harangue in the\r\n",
      "belief that, being too stupid to understand, I was a hopeless case.\r\n",
      "Then she would leave the room, but return ten minutes later to resume\r\n",
      "the contest. This continued throughout her squandering of my money--a\r\n",
      "squandering altogether out of proportion to our means. An example is\r\n",
      "the way in which she changed her first pair of horses for a pair which\r\n",
      "cost sixteen thousand francs.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Bibi,\" she said on the latter occasion as she approached me, \"surely\r\n",
      "you are not angry?\"\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"You see,\" she went on, \"I decided to spend so much upon these horses\r\n",
      "only because I can easily sell them again. They would go at any time\r\n",
      "for TWENTY thousand francs.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, yes. They are splendid horses, and you have got a splendid\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Then you are not angry?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No. Why should I be? You are wise to provide yourself with what you\r\n",
      "need, for it will all come in handy in the future. Yes, I quite see the\r\n",
      "necessity of your establishing yourself on a good basis, for without it\r\n",
      "you will never earn your million. My hundred thousand francs I look\r\n",
      "upon merely as a beginning--as a mere drop in the bucket.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Blanche, who had by no means expected such declarations from me, but,\r\n",
      "rather, an uproar and protests, was rather taken aback.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, well, what a man you are!\" she exclaimed. \"Mais tu as l'esprit\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Oui, oui, c'est ca, c'est magnifique! Ah, I know you will win them,\r\n",
      "and bring them to me when you have done so. Dis donc--you will end by\r\n",
      "making me love you. Since you are what you are, I mean to love you all\r\n",
      "the time, and never to be unfaithful to you. You see, I have not loved\r\n",
      "you before parce que je croyais que tu n'es qu'un utchitel (quelque\r\n",
      "chose comme un lacquais, n'est-ce pas?) Yet all the time I have been\r\n",
      "true to you, parce que je suis bonne fille.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\"Oh, oh! Mais tu es--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, you are lying right enough. But what makes you suppose that I\r\n",
      "should be angry? Rubbish! Il faut que jeunesse se passe. Even if that\r\n",
      "officer were here now, I should refrain from putting him out of the\r\n",
      "room if I thought you really cared for him. Only, mind you, do not give\r\n",
      "him any of my money. You hear?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You say, do you, that you would not be angry? Mais tu es un vrai\r\n",
      "philosophe, sais-tu? Oui, un vrai philosophe! Eh bien, je t'aimerai, je\r\n",
      "t'aimerai. Tu verras-tu seras content.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "True enough, from that time onward she seemed to attach herself only to\r\n",
      "me, and in this manner we spent our last ten days together. The\r\n",
      "promised \"etoiles\" I did not see, but in other respects she, to a\r\n",
      "certain extent, kept her word. Moreover, she introduced me to Hortense,\r\n",
      "who was a remarkable woman in her way, and known among us as Therese\r\n",
      "Philosophe.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But I need not enlarge further, for to do so would require a story to\r\n",
      "itself, and entail a colouring which I am loth to impart to the present\r\n",
      "narrative. The point is that with all my faculties I desired the\r\n",
      "episode to come to an end as speedily as possible. Unfortunately, our\r\n",
      "hundred thousand francs lasted us, as I have said, for very nearly a\r\n",
      "month--which greatly surprised me. At all events, Blanche bought\r\n",
      "herself articles to the tune of eighty thousand francs, and the rest\r\n",
      "sufficed just to meet our expenses of living. Towards the close of the\r\n",
      "affair, Blanche grew almost frank with me (at least, she scarcely lied\r\n",
      "to me at all)--declaring, amongst other things, that none of the debts\r\n",
      "which she had been obliged to incur were going to fall upon my head. \"I\r\n",
      "have purposely refrained from making you responsible for my bills or\r\n",
      "borrowings,\" she said, \"for the reason that I am sorry for you. Any\r\n",
      "other woman in my place would have done so, and have let you go to\r\n",
      "prison. See, then, how much I love you, and how good-hearted I am!\r\n",
      "Think, too, what this accursed marriage with the General is going to\r\n",
      "cost me!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "True enough, the marriage took place. It did so at the close of our\r\n",
      "month together, and I am bound to suppose that it was upon the ceremony\r\n",
      "that the last remnants of my money were spent. With it the\r\n",
      "episode--that is to say, my sojourn with the Frenchwoman--came to an\r\n",
      "end, and I formally retired from the scene.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It happened thus: A week after we had taken up our abode in Paris there\r\n",
      "arrived thither the General. He came straight to see us, and\r\n",
      "thenceforward lived with us practically as our guest, though he had a\r\n",
      "flat of his own as well. Blanche met him with merry badinage and\r\n",
      "laughter, and even threw her arms around him. In fact, she managed it\r\n",
      "so that he had to follow everywhere in her train--whether when\r\n",
      "promenading on the Boulevards, or when driving, or when going to the\r\n",
      "theatre, or when paying calls; and this use which she made of him quite\r\n",
      "satisfied the General. Still of imposing appearance and presence, as\r\n",
      "well as of fair height, he had a dyed moustache and whiskers (he had\r\n",
      "formerly been in the cuirassiers), and a handsome, though a somewhat\r\n",
      "wrinkled, face. Also, his manners were excellent, and he could carry a\r\n",
      "frockcoat well--the more so since, in Paris, he took to wearing his\r\n",
      "orders. To promenade the Boulevards with such a man was not only a\r\n",
      "thing possible, but also, so to speak, a thing advisable, and with this\r\n",
      "programme the good but foolish General had not a fault to find. The\r\n",
      "truth is that he had never counted upon this programme when he came to\r\n",
      "Paris to seek us out. On that occasion he had made his appearance\r\n",
      "nearly shaking with terror, for he had supposed that Blanche would at\r\n",
      "once raise an outcry, and have him put from the door; wherefore, he was\r\n",
      "the more enraptured at the turn that things had taken, and spent the\r\n",
      "month in a state of senseless ecstasy. Already I had learnt that, after\r\n",
      "our unexpected departure from Roulettenberg, he had had a sort of a\r\n",
      "fit--that he had fallen into a swoon, and spent a week in a species of\r\n",
      "garrulous delirium. Doctors had been summoned to him, but he had broken\r\n",
      "away from them, and suddenly taken a train to Paris. Of course\r\n",
      "Blanche's reception of him had acted as the best of all possible cures,\r\n",
      "but for long enough he carried the marks of his affliction, despite his\r\n",
      "present condition of rapture and delight. To think clearly, or even to\r\n",
      "engage in any serious conversation, had now become impossible for him;\r\n",
      "he could only ejaculate after each word \"Hm!\" and then nod his head in\r\n",
      "confirmation. Sometimes, also, he would laugh, but only in a nervous,\r\n",
      "hysterical sort of a fashion; while at other times he would sit for\r\n",
      "hours looking as black as night, with his heavy eyebrows knitted. Of\r\n",
      "much that went on he remained wholly oblivious, for he grew extremely\r\n",
      "absent-minded, and took to talking to himself. Only Blanche could awake\r\n",
      "him to any semblance of life. His fits of depression and moodiness in\r\n",
      "corners always meant either that he had not seen her for some while, or\r\n",
      "that she had gone out without taking him with her, or that she had\r\n",
      "omitted to caress him before departing. When in this condition, he\r\n",
      "would refuse to say what he wanted--nor had he the least idea that he\r\n",
      "was thus sulking and moping. Next, after remaining in this condition\r\n",
      "for an hour or two (this I remarked on two occasions when Blanche had\r\n",
      "gone out for the day--probably to see Albert), he would begin to look\r\n",
      "about him, and to grow uneasy, and to hurry about with an air as though\r\n",
      "he had suddenly remembered something, and must try and find it; after\r\n",
      "which, not perceiving the object of his search, nor succeeding in\r\n",
      "recalling what that object had been, he would as suddenly relapse into\r\n",
      "oblivion, and continue so until the reappearance of Blanche--merry,\r\n",
      "wanton, half-dressed, and laughing her strident laugh as she approached\r\n",
      "to pet him, and even to kiss him (though the latter reward he seldom\r\n",
      "received). Once, he was so overjoyed at her doing so that he burst into\r\n",
      "tears. Even I myself was surprised.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "From the first moment of his arrival in Paris, Blanche set herself to\r\n",
      "plead with me on his behalf; and at such times she even rose to heights\r\n",
      "of eloquence--saying that it was for ME she had abandoned him, though\r\n",
      "she had almost become his betrothed and promised to become so; that it\r\n",
      "was for HER sake he had deserted his family; that, having been in his\r\n",
      "service, I ought to remember the fact, and to feel ashamed. To all this\r\n",
      "I would say nothing, however much she chattered on; until at length I\r\n",
      "would burst out laughing, and the incident would come to an end (at\r\n",
      "first, as I have said, she had thought me a fool, but since she had\r\n",
      "come to deem me a man of sense and sensibility). In short, I had the\r\n",
      "happiness of calling her better nature into play; for though, at first,\r\n",
      "I had not deemed her so, she was, in reality, a kind-hearted woman\r\n",
      "after her own fashion. \"You are good and clever,\" she said to me\r\n",
      "towards the finish, \"and my one regret is that you are also so\r\n",
      "wrong-headed. You will NEVER be a rich man!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Un vrai Russe--un Kalmuk\" she usually called me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Several times she sent me to give the General an airing in the streets,\r\n",
      "even as she might have done with a lacquey and her spaniel; but, I\r\n",
      "preferred to take him to the theatre, to the Bal Mabille, and to\r\n",
      "restaurants. For this purpose she usually allowed me some money, though\r\n",
      "the General had a little of his own, and enjoyed taking out his purse\r\n",
      "before strangers. Once I had to use actual force to prevent him from\r\n",
      "buying a phaeton at a price of seven hundred francs, after a vehicle\r\n",
      "had caught his fancy in the Palais Royal as seeming to be a desirable\r\n",
      "present for Blanche. What could SHE have done with a\r\n",
      "seven-hundred-franc phaeton?--and the General possessed in the world\r\n",
      "but a thousand francs! The origin even of those francs I could never\r\n",
      "determine, but imagined them to have emanated from Mr. Astley--the more\r\n",
      "so since the latter had paid the family's hotel bill. As for what view\r\n",
      "the General took of myself, I think that he never divined the footing\r\n",
      "on which I stood with Blanche. True, he had heard, in a dim sort of\r\n",
      "way, that I had won a good deal of money; but more probably he supposed\r\n",
      "me to be acting as secretary--or even as a kind of servant--to his\r\n",
      "inamorata. At all events, he continued to address me, in his old\r\n",
      "haughty style, as my superior. At times he even took it upon himself to\r\n",
      "scold me. One morning in particular, he started to sneer at me over our\r\n",
      "matutinal coffee. Though not a man prone to take offence, he suddenly,\r\n",
      "and for some reason of which to this day I am ignorant, fell out with\r\n",
      "me. Of course even he himself did not know the reason. To put things\r\n",
      "shortly, he began a speech which had neither beginning nor ending, and\r\n",
      "cried out, a batons rompus, that I was a boy whom he would soon put to\r\n",
      "rights--and so forth, and so forth. Yet no one could understand what he\r\n",
      "was saying, and at length Blanche exploded in a burst of laughter.\r\n",
      "Finally something appeased him, and he was taken out for his walk. More\r\n",
      "than once, however, I noticed that his depression was growing upon him;\r\n",
      "that he seemed to be feeling the want of somebody or something; that,\r\n",
      "despite Blanche's presence, he was missing some person in particular.\r\n",
      "Twice, on these occasions, did he plunge into a conversation with me,\r\n",
      "though he could not make himself intelligible, and only went on\r\n",
      "rambling about the service, his late wife, his home, and his property.\r\n",
      "Every now and then, also, some particular word would please him;\r\n",
      "whereupon he would repeat it a hundred times in the day--even though\r\n",
      "the word happened to express neither his thoughts nor his feelings.\r\n",
      "Again, I would try to get him to talk about his children, but always he\r\n",
      "cut me short in his old snappish way, and passed to another subject.\r\n",
      "\"Yes, yes--my children,\" was all that I could extract from him. \"Yes,\r\n",
      "you are right in what you have said about them.\" Only once did he\r\n",
      "disclose his real feelings. That was when we were taking him to the\r\n",
      "theatre, and suddenly he exclaimed: \"My unfortunate children! Yes, sir,\r\n",
      "they are unfortunate children.\" Once, too, when I chanced to mention\r\n",
      "Polina, he grew quite bitter against her. \"She is an ungrateful woman!\"\r\n",
      "he exclaimed. \"She is a bad and ungrateful woman! She has broken up a\r\n",
      "family. If there were laws here, I would have her impaled. Yes, I\r\n",
      "would.\" As for De Griers, the General would not have his name\r\n",
      "mentioned. \"He has ruined me,\" he would say. \"He has robbed me, and cut\r\n",
      "my throat. For two years he was a perfect nightmare to me. For months\r\n",
      "at a time he never left me in my dreams. Do not speak of him again.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was now clear to me that Blanche and he were on the point of coming\r\n",
      "to terms; yet, true to my usual custom, I said nothing. At length,\r\n",
      "Blanche took the initiative in explaining matters. She did so a week\r\n",
      "before we parted.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Il a du chance,\" she prattled, \"for the Grandmother is now REALLY ill,\r\n",
      "and therefore, bound to die. Mr. Astley has just sent a telegram to say\r\n",
      "so, and you will agree with me that the General is likely to be her\r\n",
      "heir. Even if he should not be so, he will not come amiss, since, in\r\n",
      "the first place, he has his pension, and, in the second place, he will\r\n",
      "be content to live in a back room; whereas I shall be Madame General,\r\n",
      "and get into a good circle of society\" (she was always thinking of\r\n",
      "this) \"and become a Russian chatelaine. Yes, I shall have a mansion of\r\n",
      "my own, and peasants, and a million of money at my back.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But, suppose he should prove jealous? He might demand all sorts of\r\n",
      "things, you know. Do you follow me?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, dear no! How ridiculous that would be of him! Besides, I have\r\n",
      "taken measures to prevent it. You need not be alarmed. That is to say,\r\n",
      "I have induced him to sign notes of hand in Albert's name.\r\n",
      "Consequently, at any time I could get him punished. Isn't he\r\n",
      "ridiculous?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Very well, then. Marry him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And, in truth, she did so--though the marriage was a family one only,\r\n",
      "and involved no pomp or ceremony. In fact, she invited to the nuptials\r\n",
      "none but Albert and a few other friends. Hortense, Cleopatre, and the\r\n",
      "rest she kept firmly at a distance. As for the bridegroom, he took a\r\n",
      "great interest in his new position. Blanche herself tied his tie, and\r\n",
      "Blanche herself pomaded him--with the result that, in his frockcoat and\r\n",
      "white waistcoat, he looked quite comme il faut.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Il est, pourtant, TRES comme il faut,\" Blanche remarked when she\r\n",
      "issued from his room, as though the idea that he was \"TRES comme il\r\n",
      "faut\" had impressed even her. For myself, I had so little knowledge of\r\n",
      "the minor details of the affair, and took part in it so much as a\r\n",
      "supine spectator, that I have forgotten most of what passed on this\r\n",
      "occasion. I only remember that Blanche and the Widow figured at it, not\r\n",
      "as \"de Cominges,\" but as \"du Placet.\" Why they had hitherto been \"de\r\n",

      "General, that he liked the name \"du Placet\" even better than he had\r\n",
      "liked the name \"de Cominges.\" On the morning of the wedding, he paced\r\n",
      "the salon in his gala attire and kept repeating to himself with an air\r\n",
      "of great gravity and importance: \"Mlle. Blanche du Placet! Mlle.\r\n",
      "Blanche du Placet, du Placet!\" He beamed with satisfaction as he did\r\n",
      "so. Both in the church and at the wedding breakfast he remained not\r\n",
      "only pleased and contented, but even proud. She too underwent a change,\r\n",
      "for now she assumed an air of added dignity.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I must behave altogether differently,\" she confided to me with a\r\n",
      "serious air. \"Yet, mark you, there is a tiresome circumstance of which\r\n",
      "I had never before thought--which is, how best to pronounce my new\r\n",
      "family name. Zagorianski, Zagozianski, Madame la Generale de Sago,\r\n",
      "Madame la Generale de Fourteen Consonants--oh these infernal Russian\r\n",
      "names! The LAST of them would be the best to use, don't you think?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At length the time had come for us to part, and Blanche, the egregious\r\n",
      "Blanche, shed real tears as she took her leave of me. \"Tu etais bon\r\n",
      "enfant\" she said with a sob. \"Je te croyais bete et tu en avais l'air,\r\n",
      "but it suited you.\" Then, having given me a final handshake, she\r\n",
      "exclaimed, \"Attends!\"; whereafter, running into her boudoir, she\r\n",
      "brought me thence two thousand-franc notes. I could scarcely believe my\r\n",
      "eyes! \"They may come in handy for you,\" she explained, \"for, though you\r\n",
      "are a very learned tutor, you are a very stupid man. More than two\r\n",
      "thousand francs, however, I am not going to give you, for the reason\r\n",
      "that, if I did so, you would gamble them all away. Now good-bye. Nous\r\n",
      "serons toujours bons amis, and if you win again, do not fail to come to\r\n",
      "me, et tu seras heureux.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I myself had still five hundred francs left, as well as a watch worth a\r\n",
      "thousand francs, a few diamond studs, and so on. Consequently, I could\r\n",
      "subsist for quite a length of time without particularly bestirring\r\n",
      "myself. Purposely I have taken up my abode where I am now partly to\r\n",
      "pull myself together, and partly to wait for Mr. Astley, who, I have\r\n",
      "learnt, will soon be here for a day or so on business. Yes, I know\r\n",
      "that, and then--and then I shall go to Homburg. But to Roulettenberg I\r\n",
      "shall not go until next year, for they say it is bad to try one's luck\r\n",
      "twice in succession at a table. Moreover, Homburg is where the best\r\n",
      "play is carried on.\r\n",

      "XVII\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It is a year and eight months since I last looked at these notes of\r\n",
      "mine. I do so now only because, being overwhelmed with depression, I\r\n",
      "wish to distract my mind by reading them through at random. I left them\r\n",
      "off at the point where I was just going to Homburg. My God, with what a\r\n",
      "light heart (comparatively speaking) did I write the concluding\r\n",
      "lines!--though it may be not so much with a light heart, as with a\r\n",
      "measure of self-confidence and unquenchable hope. At that time had I\r\n",
      "any doubts of myself? Yet behold me now. Scarcely a year and a half\r\n",
      "have passed, yet I am in a worse position than the meanest beggar. But\r\n",
      "what is a beggar? A fig for beggary! I have ruined myself--that is all.\r\n",
      "Nor is there anything with which I can compare myself; there is no\r\n",
      "moral which it would be of any use for you to read to me. At the\r\n",
      "present moment nothing could well be more incongruous than a moral. Oh,\r\n",
      "you self-satisfied persons who, in your unctuous pride, are forever\r\n",
      "ready to mouth your maxims--if only you knew how fully I myself\r\n",
      "comprehend the sordidness of my present state, you would not trouble to\r\n",
      "wag your tongues at me! What could you say to me that I do not already\r\n",
      "know? Well, wherein lies my difficulty? It lies in the fact that by a\r\n",
      "single turn of a roulette wheel everything for me, has become changed.\r\n",
      "Yet, had things befallen otherwise, these moralists would have been\r\n",
      "among the first (yes, I feel persuaded of it) to approach me with\r\n",
      "friendly jests and congratulations. Yes, they would never have turned\r\n",
      "from me as they are doing now! A fig for all of them! What am I? I am\r\n",
      "zero--nothing. What shall I be tomorrow? I may be risen from the dead,\r\n",
      "and have begun life anew. For still, I may discover the man in myself,\r\n",
      "if only my manhood has not become utterly shattered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I went, I say, to Homburg, but afterwards went also to Roulettenberg,\r\n",
      "as well as to Spa and Baden; in which latter place, for a time, I acted\r\n",
      "as valet to a certain rascal of a Privy Councillor, by name Heintze,\r\n",
      "who until lately was also my master here. Yes, for five months I lived\r\n",
      "my life with lacqueys! That was just after I had come out of\r\n",
      "Roulettenberg prison, where I had lain for a small debt which I owed.\r\n",
      "Out of that prison I was bailed by--by whom? By Mr. Astley? By Polina?\r\n",
      "I do not know. At all events, the debt was paid to the tune of two\r\n",
      "hundred thalers, and I sallied forth a free man. But what was I to do\r\n",
      "with myself? In my dilemma I had recourse to this Heintze, who was a\r\n",
      "young scapegrace, and the sort of man who could speak and write three\r\n",
      "languages. At first I acted as his secretary, at a salary of thirty\r\n",
      "gulden a month, but afterwards I became his lacquey, for the reason\r\n",
      "that he could not afford to keep a secretary--only an unpaid servant. I\r\n",
      "had nothing else to turn to, so I remained with him, and allowed myself\r\n",
      "to become his flunkey. But by stinting myself in meat and drink I\r\n",
      "saved, during my five months of service, some seventy gulden; and one\r\n",
      "evening, when we were at Baden, I told him that I wished to resign my\r\n",
      "post, and then hastened to betake myself to roulette.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oh, how my heart beat as I did so! No, it was not the money that I\r\n",
      "valued--what I wanted was to make all this mob of Heintzes, hotel\r\n",
      "proprietors, and fine ladies of Baden talk about me, recount my story,\r\n",
      "wonder at me, extol my doings, and worship my winnings. True, these\r\n",
      "were childish fancies and aspirations, but who knows but that I might\r\n",
      "meet Polina, and be able to tell her everything, and see her look of\r\n",
      "surprise at the fact that I had overcome so many adverse strokes of\r\n",
      "fortune. No, I had no desire for money for its own sake, for I was\r\n",
      "perfectly well aware that I should only squander it upon some new\r\n",
      "Blanche, and spend another three weeks in Paris after buying a pair of\r\n",
      "horses which had cost sixteen thousand francs. No, I never believed\r\n",
      "myself to be a hoarder; in fact, I knew only too well that I was a\r\n",
      "spendthrift. And already, with a sort of fear, a sort of sinking in my\r\n",
      "heart, I could hear the cries of the croupiers--\"Trente et un, rouge,\r\n",
      "impair et passe,\" \"Quarte, noir, pair et manque.\"  How greedily I gazed\r\n",
      "upon the gaming-table, with its scattered louis d'or, ten-gulden\r\n",
      "pieces, and thalers; upon the streams of gold as they issued from the\r\n",
      "croupier's hands, and piled themselves up into heaps of gold\r\n",
      "scintillating as fire; upon the ell--long rolls of silver lying around\r\n",
      "the croupier. Even at a distance of two rooms I could hear the chink of\r\n",
      "that money--so much so that I nearly fell into convulsions.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ah, the evening when I took those seventy gulden to the gaming table\r\n",
      "was a memorable one for me. I began by staking ten gulden upon passe.\r\n",
      "For passe I had always had a sort of predilection, yet I lost my stake\r\n",
      "upon it. This left me with sixty gulden in silver. After a moment's\r\n",
      "thought I selected zero--beginning by staking five gulden at a time.\r\n",
      "Twice I lost, but the third round suddenly brought up the desired coup.\r\n",
      "I could almost have died with joy as I received my one hundred and\r\n",
      "seventy-five gulden. Indeed, I have been less pleased when, in former\r\n",
      "times, I have won a hundred thousand gulden. Losing no time, I staked\r\n",
      "another hundred gulden upon the red, and won; two hundred upon the red,\r\n",
      "and won; four hundred upon the black, and won; eight hundred upon\r\n",
      "manque, and won. Thus, with the addition of the remainder of my\r\n",
      "original capital, I found myself possessed, within five minutes, of\r\n",
      "seventeen hundred gulden.  Ah, at such moments one forgets both oneself\r\n",
      "and one's former failures! This I had gained by risking my very life. I\r\n",
      "had dared so to risk, and behold, again I was a member of mankind!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I went and hired a room, I shut myself up in it, and sat counting my\r\n",
      "money until three o'clock in the morning. To think that when I awoke on\r\n",
      "the morrow, I was no lacquey! I decided to leave at once for Homburg.\r\n",
      "There I should neither have to serve as a footman nor to lie in prison.\r\n",
      "Half an hour before starting, I went and ventured a couple of\r\n",
      "stakes--no more; with the result that, in all, I lost fifteen hundred\r\n",
      "florins. Nevertheless, I proceeded to Homburg, and have now been there\r\n",
      "for a month.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Of course, I am living in constant trepidation, playing for the\r\n",
      "smallest of stakes, and always looking out for something--calculating,\r\n",
      "standing whole days by the gaming-tables to watch the play--even seeing\r\n",
      "that play in my dreams--yet seeming, the while, to be in some way\r\n",
      "stiffening, to be growing caked, as it were, in mire. But I must\r\n",
      "conclude my notes, which I finish under the impression of a recent\r\n",
      "encounter with Mr. Astley. I had not seen him since we parted at\r\n",
      "Roulettenberg, and now we met quite by accident. At the time I was\r\n",
      "walking in the public gardens, and meditating upon the fact that not\r\n",
      "only had I still some fifty gulden in my possession, but also I had\r\n",
      "fully paid up my hotel bill three days ago. Consequently, I was in a\r\n",
      "position to try my luck again at roulette; and if I won anything I\r\n",
      "should be able to continue my play, whereas, if I lost what I now\r\n",
      "possessed, I should once more have to accept a lacquey's place,\r\n",
      "provided that, in the alternative, I failed to discover a Russian\r\n",
      "family which stood in need of a tutor. Plunged in these reflections, I\r\n",
      "started on my daily walk through the Park and forest towards a\r\n",
      "neighbouring principality. Sometimes, on such occasions, I spent four\r\n",
      "hours on the way, and would return to Homburg tired and hungry; but, on\r\n",
      "this particular occasion, I had scarcely left the gardens for the Park\r\n",
      "when I caught sight of Astley seated on a bench. As soon as he\r\n",
      "perceived me, he called me by name, and I went and sat down beside him;\r\n",
      "but, on noticing that he seemed a little stiff in his manner, I\r\n",
      "hastened to moderate the expression of joy which the sight of him had\r\n",
      "called forth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"YOU here?\" he said. \"Well, I had an idea that I should meet you. Do\r\n",
      "not trouble to tell me anything, for I know all--yes, all. In fact,\r\n",
      "your whole life during the past twenty months lies within my knowledge.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"How closely you watch the doings of your old friends!\" I replied.\r\n",
      "\"That does you infinite credit. But stop a moment. You have reminded me\r\n",
      "of something. Was it you who bailed me out of Roulettenberg prison when\r\n",
      "I was lying there for a debt of two hundred gulden? SOMEONE did so.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh dear no!--though I knew all the time that you were lying there.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Perhaps you could tell me who DID bail me out?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No; I am afraid I could not.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What a strange thing! For I know no Russians at all here, so it cannot\r\n",
      "have been a Russian who befriended me. In Russia we Orthodox folk DO go\r\n",
      "bail for one another, but in this case I thought it must have been done\r\n",
      "by some English stranger who was not conversant with the ways of the\r\n",
      "country.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Astley seemed to listen to me with a sort of surprise. Evidently he\r\n",
      "had expected to see me looking more crushed and broken than I was.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well,\" he said--not very pleasantly, \"I am none the less glad to find\r\n",
      "that you retain your old independence of spirit, as well as your\r\n",
      "buoyancy.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Which means that you are vexed at not having found me more abased and\r\n",
      "humiliated than I am?\" I retorted with a smile.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Astley was not quick to understand this, but presently did so and\r\n",
      "laughed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Your remarks please me as they always did,\" he continued. \"In those\r\n",
      "words I see the clever, triumphant, and, above all things, cynical\r\n",
      "friend of former days. Only Russians have the faculty of combining\r\n",
      "within themselves so many opposite qualities. Yes, most men love to see\r\n",
      "their best friend in abasement; for generally it is on such abasement\r\n",
      "that friendship is founded. All thinking persons know that ancient\r\n",
      "truth. Yet, on the present occasion, I assure you, I am sincerely glad\r\n",
      "to see that you are NOT cast down. Tell me, are you never going to give\r\n",
      "up gambling?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Damn the gambling! Yes, I should certainly have given it up, were it\r\n",
      "not that--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That you are losing? I thought so. You need not tell me any more. I\r\n",
      "know how things stand, for you have said that last in despair, and\r\n",
      "therefore, truthfully. Have you no other employment than gambling?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No; none whatever.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Astley gave me a searching glance. At that time it was ages since I had\r\n",
      "last looked at a paper or turned the pages of a book.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You are growing blase,\" he said. \"You have not only renounced life,\r\n",
      "with its interests and social ties, but the duties of a citizen and a\r\n",
      "man; you have not only renounced the friends whom I know you to have\r\n",
      "had, and every aim in life but that of winning money; but you have also\r\n",
      "renounced your memory. Though I can remember you in the strong, ardent\r\n",
      "period of your life, I feel persuaded that you have now forgotten every\r\n",
      "better feeling of that period--that your present dreams and aspirations\r\n",
      "of subsistence do not rise above pair, impair rouge, noir, the twelve\r\n",
      "middle numbers, and so forth.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Enough, Mr. Astley!\" I cried with some irritation--almost in anger.\r\n",
      "\"Kindly do not recall to me any more recollections, for I can remember\r\n",
      "things for myself. Only for a time have I put them out of my head. Only\r\n",
      "until I shall have rehabilitated myself, am I keeping my memory dulled.\r\n",
      "When that hour shall come, you will see me arise from the dead.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then you will have to be here another ten years,\" he replied. \"Should\r\n",
      "I then be alive, I will remind you--here, on this very bench--of what I\r\n",
      "have just said. In fact, I will bet you a wager that I shall do so.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Say no more,\" I interrupted impatiently. \"And to show you that I have\r\n",
      "not wholly forgotten the past, may I enquire where Mlle. Polina is? If\r\n",
      "it was not you who bailed me out of prison, it must have been she. Yet\r\n",
      "never have I heard a word concerning her.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No, I do not think it was she. At the present moment she is in\r\n",
      "Switzerland, and you will do me a favour by ceasing to ask me these\r\n",
      "questions about her.\" Astley said this with a firm, and even an angry,\r\n",
      "air.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Which means that she has dealt you a serious wound?\" I burst out with\r\n",
      "an involuntary sneer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Mlle. Polina,\" he continued, \"Is the best of all possible living\r\n",
      "beings; but, I repeat, that I shall thank you to cease questioning me\r\n",
      "about her. You never really knew her, and her name on your lips is an\r\n",
      "offence to my moral feeling.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Indeed? On what subject, then, have I a better right to speak to you\r\n",
      "than on this? With it are bound up all your recollections and mine.\r\n",
      "However, do not be alarmed: I have no wish to probe too far into your\r\n",
      "private, your secret affairs. My interest in Mlle. Polina does not\r\n",
      "extend beyond her outward circumstances and surroundings. About them\r\n",
      "you could tell me in two words.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, on condition that the matter shall end there, I will tell you\r\n",
      "that for a long time Mlle. Polina was ill, and still is so. My mother\r\n",
      "and sister entertained her for a while at their home in the north of\r\n",
      "England, and thereafter Mlle. Polina's grandmother (you remember the\r\n",
      "mad old woman?) died, and left Mlle. Polina a personal legacy of seven\r\n",
      "thousand pounds sterling. That was about six months ago, and now Mlle.\r\n",
      "is travelling with my sister's family--my sister having since married.\r\n",
      "Mlle.'s little brother and sister also benefited by the Grandmother's\r\n",
      "will, and are now being educated in London. As for the General, he died\r\n",
      "in Paris last month, of a stroke. Mlle. Blanche did well by him, for\r\n",
      "she succeeded in having transferred to herself all that he received\r\n",
      "from the Grandmother. That, I think, concludes all that I have to tell.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And De Griers? Is he too travelling in Switzerland?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No; nor do I know where he is. Also I warn you once more that you had\r\n",
      "better avoid such hints and ignoble suppositions; otherwise you will\r\n",
      "assuredly have to reckon with me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What? In spite of our old friendship?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, in spite of our old friendship.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then I beg your pardon a thousand times, Mr. Astley. I meant nothing\r\n",
      "offensive to Mlle. Polina, for I have nothing of which to accuse her.\r\n",
      "Moreover, the question of there being anything between this Frenchman\r\n",
      "and this Russian lady is not one which you and I need discuss, nor even\r\n",
      "attempt to understand.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"If,\" replied Astley, \"you do not care to hear their names coupled\r\n",
      "together, may I ask you what you mean by the expressions 'this\r\n",
      "Frenchman,' 'this Russian lady,' and 'there being anything between\r\n",
      "them'? Why do you call them so particularly a 'Frenchman' and a\r\n",
      "'Russian lady'?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah, I see you are interested, Mr. Astley. But it is a long, long\r\n",
      "story, and calls for a lengthy preface. At the same time, the question\r\n",
      "is an important one, however ridiculous it may seem at the first\r\n",
      "glance. A Frenchman, Mr. Astley, is merely a fine figure of a man. With\r\n",
      "this you, as a Britisher, may not agree. With it I also, as a Russian,\r\n",
      "may not agree--out of envy. Yet possibly our good ladies are of another\r\n",
      "opinion. For instance, one may look upon Racine as a broken-down,\r\n",
      "hobbledehoy, perfumed individual--one may even be unable to read him;\r\n",
      "and I too may think him the same, as well as, in some respects, a\r\n",
      "subject for ridicule. Yet about him, Mr. Astley, there is a certain\r\n",
      "charm, and, above all things, he is a great poet--though one might like\r\n",
      "to deny it. Yes, the Frenchman, the Parisian, as a national figure, was\r\n",

      "once appeared to her in the transfigured guise of a marquis, of a\r\n",
      "disenchanted and ruined liberal who was doing his best to help her\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "I were also to tell you that she still loves you, you would none the\r\n",
      "less have to remain where you are. Yes, you have ruined yourself beyond\r\n",
      "redemption. Once upon a time you had a certain amount of talent, and\r\n",
      "you were of a lively disposition, and your good looks were not to be\r\n",
      "despised. You might even have been useful to your country, which needs\r\n",
      "men like you. Yet you remained here, and your life is now over. I am\r\n",
      "not blaming you for this--in my view all Russians resemble you, or are\r\n",
      "inclined to do so. If it is not roulette, then it is something else.\r\n",
      "The exceptions are very rare. Nor are you the first to learn what a\r\n",
      "taskmaster is yours. For roulette is not exclusively a Russian game.\r\n",
      "Hitherto, you have honourably preferred to serve as a lacquey rather\r\n",
      "than to act as a thief; but what the future may have in store for you I\r\n",
      "tremble to think. Now good-bye. You are in want of money, I suppose?\r\n",
      "Then take these ten louis d'or. More I shall not give you, for you\r\n",

      "\"No, Mr. Astley. After all that has been said I--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"TAKE CARE of them!\" repeated my friend. \"I am certain you are still a\r\n",
      "gentleman, and therefore I give you the money as one gentleman may give\r\n",
      "money to another. Also, if I could be certain that you would leave both\r\n",

      "give you a thousand pounds down to start life afresh; but, I give you\r\n",
